	var article_1_content = "<p>Since the days of the Orient Express, luxury trains have been criss-crossing the continents in hallowed style. These gentrified time capsules on wheels, many of them decorated in the fashion of Victorian or Edwardian interiors and equipped with five-star comforts and silver service all the way, whisk travellers off to a bygone day when, in many ways, you had no choice but to take time off to enjoy the good things in life.</p><p>Rovos Rail in South Africa and The Ghan in Australia are two of such luxury trains that recreate that air of period aristocracy for their passengers today which, when combined with the fabled romance of rail journeys, leave other modes of luxury transportation in the dust.</p><p>As the founder and CEO of Rovos Rail, Rohan Vos, puts it, what sets train passengers apart from the rest is that they can afford that precious commodity called time. \"Train travel is ‘slow travel’ and it is the new luxury,\" he says. \"Slow travel is all about taking the time to eat, sleep, breathe in fresh air and enjoy the great scenery which changes continuously from your window.</p><p>\"In the high-tech era, time is a luxury and our leisurely travel experience offers the luxury of time: time to relax, to reconnect with your loved ones and to really enjoy the simple pleasures of life.\"</p><p><b>It Started With The Orient Express</b></p><p>Any talk of luxury train travel brings to mind the Orient Express, the pioneer of the genre. In 1833, the first Orient Express train set off from Paris for Istanbul, traversing continental Europe and spearheading the business of luxury train travel. In a history that spanned more than a century, countless characters of great fame and notoriety have been on board, leaving behind a legacy of stories and fables that spawned six films, 19 novels, and even a song. Best known of these is perhaps Agatha Christie’s thriller Murder On The Orient Express, which was turned into a film classic.</p><p>Christie once said: \"To travel by train is to see nature and human beings, towns and churches and rivers, in fact, to see life.\"</p><p><b>With Luxury Trains Come Living Heritage</b></p><p>Many luxury trains have one thing in common: a long and colourful history. Half a century after the Orient Express first rolled over the tracks, a new train service was inaugurated in Australia. The Ghan’s first journey began in Adelaide, in the south of Australia, back in 1929. Its destination was Alice Springs, in the desert heart of the continent. In 2004, the north-south railway was completed, spanning some 3,000km. Passengers on board The Ghan can now travel by rail from Adelaide all the way to Darwin in the north, taking in the endless red deserts, the majestic Flinders Range and other stunning landscapes along the way in a journey lasting three days and two nights.</p><p>Tony Braxton-Smith, CEO of The Ghan, says: \"Train travel appeals most to those who understand that holidays are more than getting to the destination; they are most enjoyable when the journey itself provides an experience to be savoured. A journey on one of our trains is an unforgettable holiday experience – it is about travelling in style and exploring a part of Australia that can’t be appreciated from 30,000 feet above in a plane.\"</p><p>Onboard service on The Ghan comes in three classes: platinum, gold and red. At the highest end, platinum service cabins feature fittings made predominantly of Australian oak and has a luxurious ensuite bathroom. In the day, the cabin can be converted into a private lounge complete with tables and chairs, making it the perfect space to relax with friends or to enjoy the passing sights. At night, the cabin turns into a double bedroom as comfortable as any high-end suite in a luxury hotel.</p><p>For those who wish to hold an unforgettable private party or a corporate meeting with a difference on The Ghan, four carriages each with its distinct style are also available for hire. The carriages all feature facilities such as private kitchens and boardrooms.</p><p>An unexpected feature of The Ghan is the live entertainment on board, provided by local performers in exchange for a ride. Braxton-Smith likes the surprises that spring from this arrangement: \"Travelling on The Ghan from Darwin with my wife, over dinner we met a bush poet and balladeer. With a little encouragement, after dinner in the Outback Explorer Lounge, he entertained us with songs, poems and stories of the history of Australia. It was completely spontaneous and added a fascinating dimension to our journey.\"</p><p><b>Skip The Jeep</b></p><p>If it is a rail safari experience you are after, look no further than South Africa’s Rovos Rail. One of the train’s most popular itineraries is a 13-night African safari trip from Cape Town to Dar es Salaam. The train traverses wildlife reserves, waterfalls, open plains, forests, ridges and cliffs in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania. Rovos Rail is not unlike an elegant aristocrat, proudly making its way through the south of the African continent as the self-titled \"Pride of Africa\".</p><p>Rovos Rail’s private station, located within Capital Park, adds to its allure. Passengers are treated to a Victorian-style waiting room and platform at the station and CEO Vos personally sends off the up to 72 travellers with a speech and a toast. A live band plays as they make their way down the red carpet to board the antique train powered by a steam engine.</p><p>On board, the cabins are decked out in full Edwardian style from over a century ago. The large windows can be opened to take in the safari air and sights. The last car on the train is an observatory carriage with a deck that provides a prime spot for looking out onto the natural beauty of Africa. From there, it is not uncommon to spot gazelles, ostriches and other animals in the wild.<p><b>If You Have Time To Kilt</b></p><p>As South Africa has Rovos Rail, Scotland boasts of The Royal Scotsman that plies the famous highlands.</p><p>Part of the Orient Express group, The Royal Scotsman sets off from Edinburgh and circles Scotland for a week before returning. The train carries no more than 36 travellers at a time, making the journey a lot more intimate than in the bigger trains.</p><p>Besides soaking in the sights of picturesque lakes and imposing castles, passengers can also disembark at various stations to visit local distilleries and residences and chat with the locals. An open observatory car at the end of the train allows passengers to enjoy the passing highland scenery in Edwardian-style comfort. For a particularly Scottish experience, The Royal Scotsman also offers a special service on board: the custom-tailoring of traditional tartan suits for passengers. Gentlemen can chose from traditional Scots kilt, trousers or jackets, while the ladies have a choice of different skirts.</p><p><b>Machu To Shout About</b></p><p>There is one decadent way to visit the Machu Picchu ruins in Peru, where an ancient city once stood at 2,500m above sea level. Peru’s Hiram Bingham train, also a part of the Orient Express Group, carries up to 84 passengers between Cusco city and the enigmatic Machu Picchu in a four-hour journey.</p><p>Hiram Bingham is probably the shortest luxury train in the world with only four carriages. Two of these are dining cars, one is an observatory and bar and the last is a kitchen car. Along the way, it twists through the breathtaking Andes, heading west along the gushing Urubamba River and passing towering mountains to reach Machu Picchu.</p><p>Hiram Bingham boasts luxurious, elegant, and spacious carriages that embody the best of the Pullman carriages from the 1920s. During the journey, the Peruvian band onboard plays South American music and passengers are also treated to a brandy cocktail, Pisco Sour, unique to this part of the world. On arrival at Machu Picchu, a guided tour of the mysterious ruins is provided. As a spokesperson from the Orient Express group puts it, a visit to Machu Picchu counts as a trip of a lifetime for many and taking the Hiram Bingham completes the magical memorable experience.</p>";

	var article_9_content = "<p>If you are running low on ideas for your next summer vacation, consider holidaying on a yacht of a celebrity designer.</p><p>Once a private retreat reserved for the use of only family and friends, Beluga, the luxury pleasure cruiser belonging to Anouska Hempel, the British socialite, designer and hotelier, is available for private charter for the first time this summer.</p><p>Hempel, 69, is best known for her hotel and interior design work in such trendy abodes as the luxurious Blakes Hotels in London and Amsterdam, as well as the abstract-themed The Hempel Hotel in London. Her design portfolio also includes hotels in Brazil, Chile and Lebanon, where she has won acclaim for injecting her innovative and unique style into the hotel scene. Says Hempel: \"Everything I do is influenced by the sea. I love its romance and mystery.\"</p><p>In 1992, Hempel was at the Turkish resort area of Bodrum by the Aegean Sea when she was seized by the idea of owning her own boat. She recalls: \"I don’t know what got into me but, one day, I decided we just had to have a boat. I had always loved the boats in Bodrum, which they bring onto land in the winter to dry the keels. I felt sure that if we went down in October, when it was quiet and everyone’s holidays were over, we would find a beautiful old boat in need of some love and attention.\"</p><p>Things happened just as she had hoped and that was how Hempel found Beluga. \"She was Greek blue, which I don’t like, but we stripped away everything except the bare essentials, such as the mast, and took years re-building her. I was aiming for a relaxed, non-pretentious look for happy days at sea.\"</p><p>Hempel’s design philosophy and lifestyle are given full play in the Beluga. The 28m-long traditional wooden gullet features a black and mahogany theme, which gives it an air of classic elegance. There is ample seating on the expansive deck so that one can lounge around comfortably with the family on deck. The interior is fully air-conditioned. In addition to three cabins, there is also an office (which can be converted into a bedroom) and a kitchen. Equipment for water-skiing, scuba-diving and other water sports are available on board.</p><p>Hempel was adamant that the boat not compromise on creature comforts. \"Everyone told me I couldn’t have a proper bath on a boat but why on earth not?\" To address this, she has installed two bathrooms in the master cabin for her and her husband, complete with bathtubs so she can enjoy a hot bath whenever she likes.</p><p>Special attention was also paid to the design of the galley, for the chef’s team from Blakes Hotel to comfortably prepare meals for all on board. She says: \"This boat was always about entertaining. We could have designed another cabin but instead we preferred to have additional space for relaxing and entertaining. We can fit 18 people round the table so it’s easy to pick up friends from port to port and invite them for dinners on board.\"</p><p>With their heavy schedules, Hempel and her family have not been able to sail the Beluga as frequently as they used to and that contributed to her decision this year to entrust it exclusively to Dalmatian Destinations, an upscale bespoke travel firm, to manage private charters for it. From now to October, the company is using the Beluga to provide luxury yacht tours to Croatia. To ensure that guests will enjoy the same level of service that Hempel and her family does, it has retained the services of Jorge, her butler of 15 years, who is in charge of the care of guests on board the Beluga. For meals, guests can send in their requests and requirements before the yacht sets sail and the chefs will design the menus accordingly.</p><p>According to the itinerary designed by Dalmatian Destinations, guests will board at Montenegro and sail northward to the historic site of Dubrovnik in Croatia and then on to the central Dalmatian Islands. The region features islands scattered like stars across the sky, clear waters and plentiful sunshine as well as stunning scenery onshore – a veritable paradise. Hempel also credits Dalmatian Destinations with unbeatable local knowledge.</p><p>Hempel admits that the upkeep of a boat can be a costly affair. \"You must know that very true expression: ‘Owning a boat is like tipping money into a hole in the sea’,\" she says. Even so, she reveals that she is in the market for a larger sister ship for the Beluga.</p><p style=\"color:#666\"><b>Charter fees for the Beluga start from 35,000 euros (S$60,700) a week.

	var kot_content = "<p>Since the days of the Orient Express, luxury trains have been criss-crossing the continents in hallowed style. These gentrified time capsules on wheels, many of them decorated in the fashion of Victorian or Edwardian interiors and equipped with five-star comforts and silver service all the way, whisk travellers off to a bygone day when, in many ways, you had no choice but to take time off to enjoy the good things in life.</p><p>Rovos Rail in South Africa and The Ghan in Australia are two of such luxury trains that recreate that air of period aristocracy for their passengers today which, when combined with the fabled romance of rail journeys, leave other modes of luxury transportation in the dust.</p><p>As the founder and CEO of Rovos Rail, Rohan Vos, puts it, what sets train passengers apart from the rest is that they can afford that precious commodity called time. \"Train travel is ‘slow travel’ and it is the new luxury,\" he says. \"Slow travel is all about taking the time to eat, sleep, breathe in fresh air and enjoy the great scenery which changes continuously from your window.</p><p>\"In the high-tech era, time is a luxury and our leisurely travel experience offers the luxury of time: time to relax, to reconnect with your loved ones and to really enjoy the simple pleasures of life.\"</p><p><b>It Started With The Orient Express</b></p><p>Any talk of luxury train travel brings to mind the Orient Express, the pioneer of the genre. In 1833, the first Orient Express train set off from Paris for Istanbul, traversing continental Europe and spearheading the business of luxury train travel. In a history that spanned more than a century, countless characters of great fame and notoriety have been on board, leaving behind a legacy of stories and fables that spawned six films, 19 novels, and even a song. Best known of these is perhaps Agatha Christie’s thriller Murder On The Orient Express, which was turned into a film classic.</p><p>Christie once said: \"To travel by train is to see nature and human beings, towns and churches and rivers, in fact, to see life.\"</p><p><b>With Luxury Trains Come Living Heritage</b></p><p>Many luxury trains have one thing in common: a long and colourful history. Half a century after the Orient Express first rolled over the tracks, a new train service was inaugurated in Australia. The Ghan’s first journey began in Adelaide, in the south of Australia, back in 1929. Its destination was Alice Springs, in the desert heart of the continent. In 2004, the north-south railway was completed, spanning some 3,000km. Passengers on board The Ghan can now travel by rail from Adelaide all the way to Darwin in the north, taking in the endless red deserts, the majestic Flinders Range and other stunning landscapes along the way in a journey lasting three days and two nights.</p><p>Tony Braxton-Smith, CEO of The Ghan, says: \"Train travel appeals most to those who understand that holidays are more than getting to the destination; they are most enjoyable when the journey itself provides an experience to be savoured. A journey on one of our trains is an unforgettable holiday experience – it is about travelling in style and exploring a part of Australia that can’t be appreciated from 30,000 feet above in a plane.\"</p><p>Onboard service on The Ghan comes in three classes: platinum, gold and red. At the highest end, platinum service cabins feature fittings made predominantly of Australian oak and has a luxurious ensuite bathroom. In the day, the cabin can be converted into a private lounge complete with tables and chairs, making it the perfect space to relax with friends or to enjoy the passing sights. At night, the cabin turns into a double bedroom as comfortable as any high-end suite in a luxury hotel.</p><p>For those who wish to hold an unforgettable private party or a corporate meeting with a difference on The Ghan, four carriages each with its distinct style are also available for hire. The carriages all feature facilities such as private kitchens and boardrooms.</p><p>An unexpected feature of The Ghan is the live entertainment on board, provided by local performers in exchange for a ride. Braxton-Smith likes the surprises that spring from this arrangement: \"Travelling on The Ghan from Darwin with my wife, over dinner we met a bush poet and balladeer. With a little encouragement, after dinner in the Outback Explorer Lounge, he entertained us with songs, poems and stories of the history of Australia. It was completely spontaneous and added a fascinating dimension to our journey.\"</p><p><b>Skip The Jeep</b></p><p>If it is a rail safari experience you are after, look no further than South Africa’s Rovos Rail. One of the train’s most popular itineraries is a 13-night African safari trip from Cape Town to Dar es Salaam. The train traverses wildlife reserves, waterfalls, open plains, forests, ridges and cliffs in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania. Rovos Rail is not unlike an elegant aristocrat, proudly making its way through the south of the African continent as the self-titled \"Pride of Africa\".</p><p>Rovos Rail’s private station, located within Capital Park, adds to its allure. Passengers are treated to a Victorian-style waiting room and platform at the station and CEO Vos personally sends off the up to 72 travellers with a speech and a toast. A live band plays as they make their way down the red carpet to board the antique train powered by a steam engine.</p><p>On board, the cabins are decked out in full Edwardian style from over a century ago. The large windows can be opened to take in the safari air and sights. The last car on the train is an observatory carriage with a deck that provides a prime spot for looking out onto the natural beauty of Africa. From there, it is not uncommon to spot gazelles, ostriches and other animals in the wild.<p><b>If You Have Time To Kilt</b></p><p>As South Africa has Rovos Rail, Scotland boasts of The Royal Scotsman that plies the famous highlands.</p><p>Part of the Orient Express group, The Royal Scotsman sets off from Edinburgh and circles Scotland for a week before returning. The train carries no more than 36 travellers at a time, making the journey a lot more intimate than in the bigger trains.</p><p>Besides soaking in the sights of picturesque lakes and imposing castles, passengers can also disembark at various stations to visit local distilleries and residences and chat with the locals. An open observatory car at the end of the train allows passengers to enjoy the passing highland scenery in Edwardian-style comfort. For a particularly Scottish experience, The Royal Scotsman also offers a special service on board: the custom-tailoring of traditional tartan suits for passengers. Gentlemen can chose from traditional Scots kilt, trousers or jackets, while the ladies have a choice of different skirts.</p><p><b>Machu To Shout About</b></p><p>There is one decadent way to visit the Machu Picchu ruins in Peru, where an ancient city once stood at 2,500m above sea level. Peru’s Hiram Bingham train, also a part of the Orient Express Group, carries up to 84 passengers between Cusco city and the enigmatic Machu Picchu in a four-hour journey.</p><p>Hiram Bingham is probably the shortest luxury train in the world with only four carriages. Two of these are dining cars, one is an observatory and bar and the last is a kitchen car. Along the way, it twists through the breathtaking Andes, heading west along the gushing Urubamba River and passing towering mountains to reach Machu Picchu.</p><p>Hiram Bingham boasts luxurious, elegant, and spacious carriages that embody the best of the Pullman carriages from the 1920s. During the journey, the Peruvian band onboard plays South American music and passengers are also treated to a brandy cocktail, Pisco Sour, unique to this part of the world. On arrival at Machu Picchu, a guided tour of the mysterious ruins is provided. As a spokesperson from the Orient Express group puts it, a visit to Machu Picchu counts as a trip of a lifetime for many and taking the Hiram Bingham completes the magical memorable experience.</p>";

		var kot1_content = "<img src='images/Assets/chairman.png'></img><b><p>Memories are inextricably tied to chairs and places we sit to rest our souls<br/>NARRATED ROYSTON TAN TEXT LIM FONG WEI</P><p/><p>Royston Tan<br/>Filemaker</p></b><p>I can chart my memories through four chairs.</p><p>Why chairs? We spend nearly half of our lives on our two feet or sitting down. More than mere furniture, chairs bear the imprints of our lives, both shared and private, over generations. That’s why. </p><p>Since I have gotten my hands on a smartphone with a great camera, I have been obsessively documenting chairs, like they were people. A big bulk of my smartphone’s photo album consists of chairs, mostly old and tattered ones. I do like them old. </p><p>You see, I have been intrigued by chairs since childhood, when even a bus journey could easily segue into an imaginary and sensory trip. I’d sit on the PVC seat of an old SBS bus, slightly indented and still warm from the previous commuter, and begin to conjure up stories about the traveller who had once shared this space with me. </p><p>Like beds, I find chairs particularly intimate. They also inhabit a fuzzy realm that is both private and public. Your private space might be invaded when you have to share a seat with someone, perhaps a friend, perhaps a stranger, and as you both negotiate your boundaries, and whether to cross or not to cross them, you form a relationship.</p><p>Every crack in an old, beat-up chair tells a story. I am even contemplating renting a storage space to keep the old chairs I have been slowly picking up over the years. It’d be a sort of a chair orphanage, you might say. When I see an old chair, I often wonder about its past and present life. It may be old, yet it keeps its dignity, like an old prostitute defiantly strutting down a back alley, a most improbable leading lady fighting back the torrent of time.</p><p><b><span>The One-Year-Old Chair<br />A kampong in the late 1970s;<br />The last of the kampong residents</span></b></p><p>My family belongs probably to one of the last generations to grow up in a kampong. We were not particularly well-off. Even though my family could not afford to visit restaurants, they still wanted to celebrate my first birthday and do it properly. They rented tables and those orange plastic chairs so common in those days and held a feast at our kampong for 100 people. My aunt sewed a pair of red pants for me and I looked like a little prince decorated in a red bowtie. </p><p>The whole village attended my birthday bash. There were eggs dyed in festive red and mee sua – a long white noodle consumed on birthdays for longevity. My grandmother held me up to a butter cake sprinkled with chocolate rice and lit with one candle. Calling me by my nickname, she said: \"Ah Kiam, may you grow tall and strong.\" I can still hear her saying that today.</p><p><b><span>The Multi-generational Baby Chair<br />An old house at Everton Park;<br />A fish-shop owner and his family</span></b></p><p>This may not be my story but it still resonates with me. I chanced upon this baby chair when I was filming Old Places, a documentary about disappearing Singapore, in a house that is probably a century old. It belongs to a 60-year-old fish-shop owner. In fact, it was his chair when he was a toddler. When he had a son of his own, the son used it. Now, it has been passed down to his grandchild. </p><p>You can tell from the fresh coat of pink that it is meant for a granddaughter. The chair is hefty, as if weighed down by time. You don’t get baby chairs like this anymore. The family treasures it so much that it would get a new lick of paint whenever a new life descends upon it. I find it moving that a simple chair could lend meaning across an entire family tree.</p><p><b><span>The Hairdresser's Chairs<br />An old hair salon, circa 1950s;<br />The hairdresser and her auntie customers</span></b></p><p>To the older generation, hair salons are to women what kopitiams (or coffee shops) are to men – communal spaces where they can forge bonds and lifelong companionships. I know of one old hair salon whose owner is in her 70s. Her loyal customer for the past 50 to 60 years is an auntie of similar age, who has been coming to her shop since she was studying in Chung Hwa Girls’ School. </p><p>The auntie recalls with a mixture of shyness and pride how she had come to style her hair for a beauty pageant she took part in when she was 18. Interestingly, the pageant, as she remembers, was organised by the People’s Action Party and she had come in third. Chung Hwa was later renamed Zhonghua Secondary School. Since I went to that school, that makes the auntie, whom I am sure was quite the stunner in her day, my senior.</p><p>For decades, she has been sitting in these salon chairs, sharing intimate details of her life with her hairdresser. The line between public and private is blurred within this hermetic interior, just as one can no longer tell if they are friends or customers. Time probably stands still within this space, sealing with it the style of the hairdos it produces, circa 1950s.</p><p><b><span>Chair For \"Feeding Mosquitoes\"<br />On the footway outside a tau suan store at Lorong Chuan;<br />Our old neighbour and I</span></b></p><p>My family ran a provision shop at Lorong Chuan, next to a tau suan (mung bean dessert) store. An old man would sit on a lounge chair outside the shop so regularly, and always from morning till late afternoon, that he’d become a regular fixture there. When I was born, my family mulled over finding me the right name, till my uncle selected for the last character the word \"qian\", which means humility. </p><p>The old man apparently gave the choice his seal of approval. He nodded and said: \"That’s a good name. He will grow up to be a unique individual.\" I remember hanging out with the old man a lot. Well, it mostly involved me singing some children’s song to him over and over like a broken record and he not minding one bit. I once asked him why he was always sitting there. He replied: \"I am feeding the mosquitoes, my son.\"</p>";

On hearing that certain ringing, the bell of the ice cream man, my responding shriek of anticipation and desire was so intense and sharp that an adult member of the family was compelled to scoop me up and dash downstairs, grabbing some coins on the way. And at the cart, I had to be restrained from diving into the crater of the ice cream box. Why couldn’t they understand how that soft and cool abyss was my earliest definition of happiness?</p><p>Ice cream marked the rhythm of dusk – an evening prayer. Later on, it became the summation of a day’s outing with Dad, at a milk bar near the Capitol Theatre. I could barely see above the surface of the table, while the tri-coloured sundae seemed insurmountable. But I would prop up myself on the seat cushion with primordial will power and newly-acquired motor skills, one hand pivoting on the table, the other wielding the long ice cream spoon to scoop mouth after mouth of happiness, oblivious to Dad’s embarrassment and the reproachful stares from the next tables.</p><p>I was never quite sure if those milk bar forays were a costly indulgence, but they were Dad’s way of delivering rewards and consolations. My first months in school were a tremendous stress – the convent school compound was very far from home, grey and so vast I would lose my way each trip to the washroom. There were far too many fellow students and some teachers couldn’t even understand Mandarin. Primary One was in the afternoon session. The moment I stepped in the medieval labyrinth of the convent, I had the urge to leave. </p><p>One ring of the end-of-day bell would send me dashing to the gate. Occasionally Dad would be absent, late to fetch me. In that moment, the world and the universe collapsed around me, as I cried in hopelessness. He was really only ever slightly delayed, but feeling guilty, we would go hand in hand to the Red House across the school for a scoop of strawberry ice cream, Swiss Roll or chicken pie. In the air-conditioned coffee house, dimly lit by the lone light source of the cake display, the warm chicken bits encased in buttery puff pastry gradually restored my state of happiness. Then, father and daughter, we dragged our long shadows and hopped homeward onto a 60-something omnibus. I must have loved this food therapy, since before long this quintessentially old-fashioned chicken pie would become for me the symbol of comfort and hope in times of disappointment.</p><p>Primary Five was spent again in the afternoon session. The rewards were slightly different: When I invested extra diligence in violin practice or when he thought I had expended great efforts in school or maybe just when he wanted to go himself, we would get off the bus on North Bridge Road two stops ahead for a late lunch in Mooi Chin. </p><p>In those days, the restaurant occupied a nice old shophouse in colonial splendour. There was booth furniture in wood and the semi-private rooms were stylishly composed with old wooden screens. The set lunch menu was in the generic European style practised by Hainanese cooks – it would start with watery consomme, followed by fish fillet in butter sauce, climaxing with the Mooi Chin house specialty pork chop, then a scoop of chocolate ice cream and coffee or tea to mark the completion of the culinary cycle.</p><p>I learnt under Dad’s tutelage the art of silent soup sipping, the difference between a fish knife and one for cutting meat and how to signal by placing the cutlery in the middle of the plate when done. With that bourgeois satisfaction complete, we two would ease out of the restaurant, to go our separate ways, whiling away another afternoon of the 1970s.</p>";

I grew up in Nee Soon, an interstice between Mandai Reservoir and Nee Soon Village, with a nearby army barracks on Transit Road whose shops sold electrical and other modern goods to the Australian and New Zealand soldiers. </p><p>If you trekked down the dirt roads that led into the forests off Sembawang Road, you would reach fishing villages and farmland that left you transfixed in time past. Even then, we had notions of progress in an age without mobile phones and air-conditioned cars. </p><p>When my father decided to pile us all into his British-made Hillman for a ride, we would almost reach for our passports and head for the “city” of Katong, where the department store called Tay Buan Guan had my favourite bookstand stocking authors like Edgar Rice Burroughs (Tarzan and the Mars series, which set me on my love for sci-fi) and Capt W E Johns (Biggles, the heroic First World War pilot).</p><p>Around the Katong area, we would have sapo fun (clay pot rice) at a restaurant in what I vaguely recall as Sea View Hotel. That taste of sapo fun was entrenched in my young palate and, to this day, it has propelled me to search for that immutable flavour.</p><p>The Nee Soon area held an unchoreographed hotchpotch of experiences for me, reflecting an early Singapore that lived with all manner of influences and styles, freely and naturally.</p><p>I would walk into a Malay shop and the shopkeeper would speak to me in Malay or even Hokkien. I would walk out with a sweet in hand, with a child-like smile that had glimpsed a spirit of generosity that was indistinguishable by race, religion or language.</p><p>My young Indian neighbours, whose father ran a grocery store, could fully engage in Hokkien. For supper, I would walk egg in hand to the local char kway teow Ah Pek, who would grumpily toss it into his wok and charge me less for the plate. Or I would get an extra pound of duck from the duck rice stall, just because the vendor had a son who studied with me in school.</p><p>These are sweet memories of simple events driven by the simplest of sentiments. These moments will always be precious, because they were unmediated by prejudices or social constructions of reality that we live with now. </p><p>The natural space of Mandai was also life-transforming. It gave a young boy a free habitat to roam the forest and fuel his fantasies. Together with a few friends, I would spend many hours looking for vines that we could swing on, like we were Tarzans of Asia. </p><p>At that age, fear and apprehension were not pressing concerns, as we flew through the air across abysses that seemed danger-neutral, although we knew not what lurked beneath.</p><p>In naughtier years, we would pounce on parked cars with couples in them, create the greatest ruckus that we could pull from our throats and then run like hell. When slightly older and at those pensive times when I craved nature and solitude, I would ride my bicycle to Mandai Reservoir to read or write while absorbing the reddish hues of sunset. </p><p>I used to go to a cinema across the street to watch the bygone Chinese films of pure heroism, such as The One-Armed Swordsman, starring the handsome pig-tailed Wang Yu. It was truly an open concept, as we had to bring umbrellas to the cinema to shelter us when it rained into the roofless theatre. It was free-seating then. </p><p>I grew up on James Bond and The Man from U.N.C.L.E as well, but what made an impression on me was the TV series called Get Smart, about a madcap bumbling secret agent who somehow always won over the evil machinations of an organisation called KAOS (Chaos). So, this photograph of me is more Get Smart than Bond. Imagine a boy running around in Nee Soon, with his right shoe pressed to his ear (ie. a shoe phone), speaking to his partner Agent 99. That was me.</p>";

It was an adventure, slightly intimidating for someone as sheltered as I, but exciting for I had been educated in the English tradition and still loved the colonial influence and tradition that I had grown up with – afternoon tea, white-jacketed waiters, cocktails and all.</p><p>Although educated in Singapore, I was more than familiar with the famous writers and thinkers from Britain such as Ben Johnson, Samuel Pepys, Oscar Wilde, Bertrand Russell and their like. Steeped in the history and culture of Great Britain, I was impressed, if not awed, by this global city. </p><p>You can imagine my excitement, seeing this fabulous city that in the Victorian era had been the centre of the Empire where the Sun never set. </p><p>There, I marveled at the life-like wax works at Madam Tussauds, the fantastic jewels in the Tower of London, the fabulous collections of mummies from Egypt, porcelain from China and Turkish fireplaces in the British museums. There were plays, concerts and musicals on all the time, whereas back in Singapore, we had a very stuffy National Museum and the occasional production by the Stage Club. </p><p>I also found people in England wonderfully polite and civil. You could stop any one on the street to ask for directions and even at the flea market in Portobello Road; people were so honest that wares were open to all to touch and play with and shopkeepers did not cast a suspicious eye on anyone who walked by. </p><p>The streets were clean and the distinctive historical architecture of the houses and buildings in London did much to enhance the charm and magic of the city. </p><p>At the same time, one could not help but be aware that London was changing. It was a time when the unions were all-powerful and taking on the government. In fact, it was the battle with the coal unions that launched the career of the Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher around that time.</p><p>In October last year, or 33 years later, I was again in London, this time for work, and tasked with talking to students and young professionals from Singapore, sharing with them what Singapore is like and helping them stay in touch with home. After the talk, many students came forward asking not just about Singapore but about job opportunities. Even middle-aged people who had lived in London for 30 years asked about opportunities here. </p><p>It was a far cry from the London of the 1970s and 1980s when getting a job in London meant that you were smart and could take on the best. Everyone, given a chance, would jump at a job offer in London. Where the young once looked for jobs in London, today they look for jobs in Asia.</p><p>London architecture remains most impressive, for it has combined the modern, such as The Gherkin and many new buildings, with the old Regency and Victorian period buildings that have become distinctive of London. However, apart from the bricks and mortar, it is obvious that the soul of the city has changed.</p><p>There is a certain anxiousness not least wrought by the concerns over the uncertainty in Europe, as well as a degree of skepticism towards much of what London once stood for. After the embarrassing riots in a country that once prided itself on civility and honesty, it now faced protesters outside St Paul’s Cathedral. And where the British once prided themselves on their resilience and ability to face hardship with their famous stiff upper lip, they have now to admit that there are families among them who have been on the dole for three generations.</p><p>Even as I visit London today, there is much that is pleasantly familiar: the beautiful old buildings, Harrods, The Ritz, St Paul’s Cathedral and many others. But at the same time, there is a sense that the 21st century marks a new era for Asia. In London, we now see more Asian faces than white. Taxi drivers, shopkeepers and waitresses speak English with an accent that nobody can quite fathom. After 33 years, London has changed and Asia has left its imprint on the city as the centre of economic gravity moves from the West to the East.</p>";

So Nature had always figured largely in my childhood. </p><p>My father was a rubber broker and my mother a homemaker. They were both avid orchid enthusiasts and owned one of Singapore’s best collections of orchidaceas. Our home was always filled with colourful blooms. Over the years, I too grew to appreciate orchids. </p><p>Of the eight children in the family, I was the only one who would accompany my parents to look at different species and hybrids. While the grown-ups discussed the flowers, I was busy admiring the beautiful blooms.</p><p> In the 1950s and 1960s, orchids were prized by the wealthy and seen as status symbols. The orchid scene in the late 1970s to 1980s, however, saw a shift with the introduction of new propagation methods, particularly tissue culture, which made orchids accessible to everyone. I feel that orchids, just like any other plants, are living art sculptures. </p><p>From the love of orchids, I slowly developed an interest in botany and embarked on the road to become a botanist.</p><p>We can explain the history of Singapore through the perspective of plants. For example, in the early 1800s the colonial plantations tried out different crops like coconut, coffee, nutmeg and rubber, and attracted workers from the surrounding regions – the Malays, the Indians, the Chinese – which built the immigrant nation that became Singapore.</p><p>There’s more meaning in life than making money. Especially as our city develops rapidly, we should cherish nature even more and be aware that all the plants in the parks and gardens belong to every Singaporean. I think that most Singaporeans should have lovely memories of their visits to places like the Botanic Gardens, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve or Labrador Nature Reserve. Our network of gardens, parks, nature reserves, park connectors and tree-lined roads has not only made the living in this city so much more pleasant, it is also become an important part of our growing up here.</p><p>As Singapore progresses from a Garden City to a City in a Garden, the new Gardens by the Bay will play an integral part in Singapore’s green development. It will capture the essence of Singapore as a City in a Garden, with the perfect environment in which to live, work and play. </p><p>The best home is a very fine balance of the natural environment and the built environment. To me, Singapore is not only my homeland, it is my perfect garden.</p>";

For the rest of my weekend up on Hualien’s Taroko National Park, I was perfectly happy to repose in the resort’s pool, sipping tea, taking in the exceptionally crisp air and staring into the serene wilderness. Like a 3-D nature documentary come alive, the resort encircles you with the deeply soothing surround sound of wind brushing through the lush greenery and views of skyscraper gorges that are 250 million years old. </p><p>Cast your eye further and you will see a pagoda gleaming in gold, perched at the furthest edge of the broccoli-green mountain range. The pagoda, part of the Xiangde Temple which also houses the world’s tallest Bodhisattva statue, provides a stunning signature view for the hotel. Unsurprising then that the Silks Place resort with its to-die-for views has been awarded the highest Michelin honour of three stars (no, it is not all about gastronomy). </p><p>Why is the resort, a bejewelled creation by the Regent group and the only luxury hotel high up the Taroko Gorge, privy to such an exclusive view? It resides in the former Tian Hsyang Lodge, one of the late Taiwan President Chiang Kai-shek’s many summer retreats scattered across Taiwan. </p><p>Refurbished in 2009 in a tasteful Nordic-meets-Zen style, the 46-room retreat boasts of 10 massive river-view rooms. </p><p>The hotel’s general manager Michael Gaehler adds touches of luxe throughout: Canaries (the real thing – he was against piped-in chirping) serenade you in the lounge, where you can enjoy a 180-degree mountain view over meals and a nightcap or two. At night, you can dine in the outdoors while basking in the warmth of two large bonfires. While listening to fires crackle in the deep silence of the gorge, you cannot help but wonder if this might be how the indigenous people of the mountains got through a wintry night centuries ago? There is another bonfire at the pool, should you fancy an evening dip. It is just as well that the Taiwanese Tourism Board is stepping up its campaigns to drive traffic to the traditional attractions of the night market, street food culture and 24-hour bookstore in the city. Just two hours from the Taipei city centre (one hour by flight from Songshan Domestic Airport and a 50-minute drive up the mountain), this gem of a retreat risks being uncovered as one of Taiwan’s best-kept secrets for its accessibility. Remember, you read it here first. </p>";

				var tp_content = "<p><span><b>Slimming Effect</b></span></p><p>Rado, which was founded in 1957, maintains a clear direction and goal; it is focused on creating innovative material and designs while capitalising on its youthful vitality, instead of going head to head against other venerable Swiss watchmakers in terms of complication of movements and functions.</p><p>Matthias Breschan, CEO of Rado Global, explained his brand’s positioning as such: \"Rado is staying true to the brand’s principle of ‘unlimited spirit’ to innovate and re-invent,\" he said. \"We will continue to launch new designs and innovative movements, but we will not become manufacturers. Our goal is to launch innovative designs that can withstand the test of time.\"</p><p>He also said that the development of the world’s thinnest high-tech ceramic wristwatch, Rado True Thinline, is a show of Rado’s adherence to its core values of being visionary, innovative and iconic – its way of making its mark in history.</p><p>Breschan was at a recent Asian launch event for the Rado True Thinline series held in Hong Kong.</p><p>He also emphasised that while Rado watches, priced between US$1,000 (S$1,285) and US$4,000, cater to a larger segment compared to other luxury watches with their stratospheric sticker prices, the brand ensures that its products are of the highest quality. </p><p>Much investment goes into their design, giving buyers outstanding value for their money. To achieve this, the brand works with renowned designers such as Jasper Morrison, the acclaimed British industrial designer who was invited to collaborate on the r5.5 series of watches that have now become collectors’ items. </p><p>The official launch of the True Thinline series was celebrated with an event titled Be True. Be Unlimited. Be Rado, held late last year at the historical 136-year-old building The Bethanie in Hong Kong. Rado’s global ambassador Rene Liu was in attendance.</p><p>Rado True Thinline, the brand’s most important collection last year, comprises 20 styles of ultra-thin high-tech ceramic watches measuring only 4.9mm thick and weighing a mere 38g. To realise this ultra-thin form, all the components of the watch had to be re-worked to achieve flawless integration – including Rado’s unique ultra-thin quartz movement.</p><p>In addition, there is also a choice of watch strap in high-tech ceramic or hypoallergenic rubber. The watch cases come in black and white and feature rose gold and diamond embellished indexes. The cases also come in two sizes, both with a quartz movement of just 1mm in thickness, joined seamlessly to high-tech ceramic or rubber straps. The series fits in perfectly with the rising trend of \"bleisure\" (merging business and leisure), offering an alternative to an overly ostentatious and impractical aesthetic of excess.</p><p>While ceramic watches are becoming more common on the market, Rado’s high-tech ceramic is of another class, as it was first used in F1 race cars and also employed in the heat shield that enabled space shuttles to re-enter the earth’s atmosphere. It is valued for comfort and extreme lightness. Used in a watch, this translates to the capacity for rapid adjustment to the body’s temperature, eliminating the discomfort that comes from placing burning hot or ice cold objects against the skin. Durability is assured as the watch has a hardness of 1,250 Vickers, while its smooth, hard surface is scratch-resistant. </p><p>On the technology level, the collection of ultra-thin watches represents Rado’s fifth major breakthrough in the use of high-tech ceramic. In 1986, Rado was a pioneer in introducing the material to watchmaking. In 1991, Rado produced the world’s first white ceramic wristwatch; following that, it also launched the first platinum-coloured ceramic watch and the world’s first golden high-tech ceramic watch in 1993 and 2006 respectively. </p><p>With this latest collection, Rado has taken another step in realising the vision of its founder, who stated in the 1950s: \"If we can imagine it, we can make it. And if we can make it, we will.\"</p>";

The dragon and the phoenix represent an optimistic future, high morals as well as good fortune and prosperity, and it was Piaget’s goal to create a collection of watches that embodied this spirit. </p><p>In comparison to collections by other brands featuring oriental themes, Piaget’s collection stands out with the multitude of diamonds and stunning craftsmanship deployed, resulting in a collection dripping with grandeur. Léopold-Metzger says: “Our very best artisans have devoted their sensitivity, expertise and experience to this creation in honour of the magnificent Chinese civilisation.”</p><p>He also said the various artisans had different views on the interpretation of the theme during the creative process; the final rendition is the result of intensive research. “Even though the design team is from Europe, the dragon and phoenix we drafted are very Eastern, with a very defined and powerful image.”</p><p>The dazzling watches feature Piaget’s exquisite movements made in-house at its workshops in La Côte-aux–Fées. They range from ultra-thin calibres to complicated Tourbillon Relatif, and from classic elegant styles to spectacular high jewellery pieces.</p><p>The gala launch dinner held at the Beijing 798 Art Zone was attended by 400 guests from all over the world, with Hong Kong actor Chow Yun Fat as the guest of honour. </p><p><span><b>Piaget Dragon and Phoenix Collection</b></span></p><p>There are a total of 24 wristwatches in Piaget’s Dragon and Phoenix Collection – of these, five are highly complicated, featuring a stunning number of diamonds and gems.</p><p><span>1 Dragon and Phoenix </span><span>This pair of haute jewellery watches is the signature of the collection, completely handmade with a tiny saw; minute adjustments are then made after the gems are set.

First, the design is engraved onto the watch body to create hollows and channels. Then, a fine brush is used to deposit enamel into the gaps before several firings.</p><p>The outline is traced onto the watch by an engraver before the contours are hollowed out, creating a taille d’épargne relief engraving with very clear edges. To decide how deep and how wide the hollows are, an engraver has to rely on his experience and skill. The enamels that are used to fill the gaps are heated to 800 deg C for several firings, until a smooth and glazed finish is obtained. The Chinese character for dragon is engraved at the back of the watchcase of this unique piece.</p><br/><br/><p><span><b>Piaget Altiplano Tourbillon pocket watch </b></span><span>The miniature and grisaille techniques of enamelling are employed in combination for this pair of dragon and phoenix watches. The technique creates monochrome painted designs requiring the enameller to use black enamel for the background and Limoges white enamel for the dragon. Grand feu firing technique is used. The result is relatively translucent enamel and intense white hues. Shades of grey are obtained by stretching the white enamel to create a see-through effect – exact thickness and stretching is determined by the master enameller based on his experience. The dragon’s body thus features layer upon layer of enamelling, creating an embossed sculptural effect – but the layering is imperceptible to the naked eye (the technique is somewhat similar to that employed by ceramic makers in Jingdezhen in China’s Jiangxi province, known as blue glaze porcelain or blue white porcelain). A dragon motif and an engraving of the Chinese character for dragon are featured on the dial. Only three were produced. </span></p><br/><br/><p><span><b>Piaget Altiplano 38mm Dragon and Phoenix watch </b></span><span>The cloisonné enamelling technique is employed to create this pair of Piaget Altiplano 38mm Dragon and Phoenix watches. The decorative pattern is first outlined with a gold wire on the body of the watch. After the completion of this first step, the design is fixed by the master enameller using adragante gum, which disappears during the firing process, leaving gaps. Different coloured enamel pieces are inserted in the gaps before another firing. The process can be repeated several times to create a more intense colouring, before the final firing, after which the surface is polished and glazed. </span></p><p><span>Several variations of the technique exist and the one employed for the watches is plique à jour, where cells are glued to a fine copper base that is then dissolved with acids. The result is a transparent seamless enamelling effect. Only 38 pieces of the Altiplano 38mm Dragon and Phoenix watches have been produced.</span></p><p><span><b>Piaget Protocole XXL watch </b></span><span>Painted enamelling combines the champlevé and miniature enamelling techniques, thus demanding the highest level of artistry and patience on the part of the enameller. A gold plate (such as a pocket watch cover, back of a watch case or dial) is first covered with a coat of fired enamel that forms the background of the design. The enameller then paints the motif designs on this “canvas” by hand and applies additional layers of enamel to create the resulting design. The Chinese character for dragon is carved on the back of the crystal sapphire watch case. Only three pieces of this watch were produced.</span></p>";

						var piaget2_content = "	<p>For the world of fine watches, the Year of the Dragon offers ample business opportunities. A number of watchmakers are showcasing their creativity and craftsmanship through the dragon and phoenix theme, launching vibrant collections aimed squarely at the strong demand in China.</p><p><span><b>Richard Mille RM055 </b></span><span>Richard Mille is launching two high-profile wristwatches with a clear Chinese influence, designed respectively by Jackie Chan, a kingpin in the world of Chinese movies, and Michelle Yeoh, his female counterpart, in collabotation with Mélanie Treton-Monceyron, artistic director of Richard Mille. The RM JC Tourbillon was created especially for an auction organised by Jackie Chan’s Dragon’s Heart Foundation in Beijing last year, whose proceeds aid children in the remote areas of China. On the dial are the English and Chinese lettering for “dragon’s heart”, a reproduction of the logo of Chan’s charity in red, green and blue, which symbolise childhood, love and sharing. The back of the watch bears the words “Foundation Jackie Chan” alongside a dragon, which Chan uses as an emblem. The manual winding tourbillion features a carbon nanofibre baseplate, with hours, minutes and power reserve indicator (approximately 70 hours), torque indicator and function selector. </span></p><p><span><b>Richard Mille RM051 </b></span><span>Michelle Yeoh began working with Treton-Monceyron a year ago on timepieces inspired by Asia. One timepiece produced from this joint collaboration is a complicated watch featuring a phoenix symbol. On the watch, the mythical creature is adorned with diamonds and encases the movement in harmony with the barrel, power reserve and tourbillion. The eye-catching baseplate made of black onyx apparently absorbs negative energy, stabilises feelings and stimulates inspiration. The RM051 comes in a limited edition of 18 – which happens to be Yeoh’s favourite number. </span></p><p><span><b>Franck Muller Infinity Dragon</b> </span><span>Luxurious diamonds are combined with an intense imagining of the dragon in Franck Muller’s all-new Infinity Dragon diamond watch. Part of its Infinity series, the Infinity Dragon collection stands out for its simple lines and flowing form, and the image of a dragon poised in flight is rendered vividly in red and green, giving new life to this mysterious and powerful symbol. A total of 617 diamonds amounting to 5.15 carats are embedded in the Infinity Dragon (model 3545 D CD), which comes in five sizes.</span></p><p><span><b>Patek Philippe Ref. 5720/1G </b></span><span>Patek Philippe unleashed its most intricate craftsmanship to produce this one-of-a-kind piece. Just the gem-setting alone required some 250 to 300 hours. The watch is made of white gold and on the watch case and strap are 1,407 diamonds; the enamelled dial is rendered in 10 colours and the dragon motif on the watchcase is formed with 462 diamonds.</span></p><p><span><b>Cartier Le Cirque Animalier</b> </span><span>Cartier’s Le Cirque Animalier collection is a reflection of the brand’s focus on China: a diamond dragon in flight takes the spotlight on the 18K white gold watch case set with a total of 884 brilliant-cut diamonds of 6.28 carats. The dragon’s eyes are made of emerald and there is a push button at four o’clock which opens the case to present the 430MC movement within. Only 100 pieces of this watch have been produced. </span></p><p><span><b>Chopard L.U.C XP </b></span><span>Kiichiro Masamura, one of Japan’s living National Treasures, has created a unique dragon and phoenix motif watch for Chopard using a traditional Japanese lacquering technique known as Urushi. The intricate craft is showcased in the subtle and elegant L.U.C XP, an ultra-thin watch with the mechanical self-winding L.U.C 96HM movement.. The L.U.C XP ultra-thin watch is just 6.8mm thick and comes with a mechanical self-winding movement and 65-hour power reserve. Its 18K rose gold watchcase is complemented by a strap of black alligator-skin; it also comes with a crafted Urushi lacquer case. </span></p><p><span><b>Jacquet Droz Petite Heure Minute Dragon </b></span><span>With the brand’s most iconic watch as blueprint, Jacquet Droz launched the truly precious and unabashedly dazzling Petite Heure Minute Dragon. Its specialties of grand feu enamelling and delicate paintwork on enamel is employed to stunning effect in the creation of this timepiece. On the dial against an ivory background of grand feu enamel, two dragons battle over a pearl. The master enameller has added gold flakes to the pigments with superb mastery of skill, enhancing the brilliance of the design. Each timepiece takes a whole week of work by hand to complete. Only 88 pieces of this limited edition watch, with a power reserve of 68 hours, are available. </span></p>";

						var wine_content = "<p><b>History Through The Wine Glass</b></p><p>In Singapore’s Duxton Hill, in the Russian fine dining restaurant Buyan Haute Cuisine &amp; Caviar Bar, is a custom-made stainless steel wine cabinet that holds 20 bottles of antique wine.</p><p>More than 90 per cent of wines cannot be aged in a bottle, but the restaurant’s owner and wine collector Ravi Viswanathan, is interested only in those wines that taste better with time and have some historical value, because \"fine wine is aged\", as the saying goes. </p><p>Two bottles, in particular, have propelled the restaurant into the spotlight in the world of vintage wine collection: the world’s oldest champagne dating back to 1841 from Veuve Clicquot (whose 30,000 euro price that Viswanathan paid set a world champagne record), and the now-defunct Juglar (age unknown), salvaged from a ship that sank sometime between 1825 and 1830. The two bottles were procured at a cost of nearly $100,000. But these are not the oldest bottles in Buyan’s possession – that title goes to an 1821 Vin Jaune (French for \"yellow wine\"), housed within a dark unlabelled bottle with only a scrawl to give away its origins.</p><p>The bottle hails from Chateau Chalon in the Jura region in the east of France, the birthplace of the Vin Jaune. According to legend, the method of producing this type of wine was discovered by monks in the Middle Ages. At Chateau Chalon, the region’s top winemaker, only Vin Jaune is produced and only Savagnin grapes are used.</p><p>Vin Jaune is aged through a process similar to that used for sherry: In the barrels used for ageing the wine, a gap is left at the top to trap air that will lead to the formation of a white film of yeast. The wine is left in the oak barrel for seven years, during which it takes on the aroma of beeswax, walnut and nuts, and a warm and rich texture. </p><p>Vin Jaune is usually stored for 10 years after bottling before it is savoured. It is not uncommon to hear of bottles that are 50 or even 100 years old, but this 190-year-old bottle is a rare find indeed. 1821 was also a significant year in history – Viswanathan informs that this was the year that Napoleon died in exile on the island of Saint Helena.</p><p>Within Buyan’s cellar, the Vin Jaune lies next to another rare vintage, the 1854 Lafite-Rothschild, which comes with its own interesting history. </p><p>This was a year before the Medoc Classification came about in 1855, the first time the French had ever released something as official as this, and its influence holds sway even today. At the World Expo in Paris in 1855, brokers of Bordeaux wines were tasked to rank the wines according to a chateau’s reputation and trading price, which at that time was directly related to quality. The wines were ranked in importance from first to fifth growths (crus). A total of 60 chateaus were listed, with the addition of one in 1856. </p><p>The price of the 1854 Lafite-Rothschild was used as an index in the creation of the list and the winemaker was ranked as First Growths. </p><p>This particular Lafite also escaped the plague of the Phylloxera Vastatrix, which destroyed vast swathes of the vines in France, resulting in their replacement by resistant American Rootstocks through grafting. However, the vintage of 1854 was produced using original European Vitis Vinifera grapes that had been harvested before the plague struck. </p><p>And this is perhaps the greatest allure of wine collecting: the history behind each bottle of antique wine – what is famous, what bottles they come in and who were involved in the myth-making and their elevation. To this end, Buyan’s wine cabinet is a veritable museum.</p><p>Incidentally, century-old wines are especially sensitive to temperature and, to prevent premature ageing, they have to be stored at a lower temperature than that for normal wines. For champagnes, the optimum storage temperature is 2 to 4 deg C. Normal wine cabinets have a minimum temperature of 10 deg C, which is why the restaurant had one customised to ensure ideal conditions are met for the storage of its antique wines. This means zero vibration, no light and a temperature of 2 to 5 deg C. </p><p>Says Viswanathan, 49: \"Wine collection is an art. It must have a purpose, a motivation and, most importantly, it must bring people back to history.\" He made his fortune in investment banking and started collecting wines in France 30 years ago. Ten years ago, he relocated to Singapore with his wife and entered the restaurant business. Buyan has a collection of more than 7,000 bottles of wine exceeding $5 million in value.</p><p>\"It is easy to buy expensive wines and keep them as long as you have the means, but Buyan’s collection is not easy to come by,\" Viswanathan says. \"We actually collect very old vintages that have some relation to what happened in the world in that particular year. Therefore, our collection is like a history book waiting for the reader to go back in time and remember what happened in that particular vintage.\"</p><p>At the banquet of the Russia-Singapore Business Forum last year, the restaurant presented two bottles of 1923 Lafite-Rothschild in honour of the founding prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, who was born that year. One of the empty bottles takes pride of place in the restaurant. </p><p>Viswanathan is also particular about where the wines are produced and is firmly focused on vintages of the top winemakers. For example, from Domaine de La Romanée-Conti, widely regarded as the top wine-maker in Burgundy, he has collected La Tache, La Grande Rue, Clos Goillotte, Chateau Latour, Lafite, Haut-Brion and Y’quem, with an average of 15 to 20 vertical vintages for each label.</p><p>Buyan has another cabinet full of Bas Armagnac from Gelas, of the vintages from 1940 to 1993. He mostly buys directly from the winemakers or collectors and very rarely at auctions.</p><p>Just how much do rare antique wines cost? For reference, take a look at the annual auction of Vin Jaune in February last year, where a 1774 bottle was sold for a lofty 63,000 euros (including auction fees). In 2006, Sotheby sold a magnum bottle of 1865 Lafite for US$111,635. </p><p>Collecting a piece of history is a costly business.</p>";

							var kotI_content = "<b><p>While the debt saga in the Euro zone continues to cast shadows over global markets, Asian equities and bonds will be on fundamentally sound footing this year</p><p>TEXT AJ LEOW</p></b><p>There will be no respite for investors from market volatilities this year, no thanks to the ongoing economic woes and debt issues on the Western front – notably in the Euro zone and the United States – which have been made worse by the heady intermingling of economics and politics.</p><p>But while the markets are likely to remain choppy into the first half of the year, the good news is that the global economy is unlikely to witness the prospects of a full-blown downturn, say most investment experts.</p><p>\"We are not expecting a double-dip recession but neither are we looking at strong economic growth. The better-than-expected US economic data for the fourth quarter indicates that the US recovery is intact though at very restrained levels,\" notes Simon Flood, the Chief Investment Officer for Lion Global Investors Ltd here in Singapore and member of the OCBC Wealth Panel.</p><p>He adds that there is also the buffer in the capabilities of most Asian governments, which are in the enviable position to boost growth through interest-rate cuts or stimulus spending if the demand and confidence levels in the US dip; or if the combination of sovereign and bank deleveraging in Europe brings about a knock-on impact on the rest of the world, which includes Asia.</p>	<p>Furthermore, there is little to suggest that China – the world’s second largest economy with a GDP of US$5 trillion (S$6.5 trillion) – will be experiencing a drastic slowdown despite recent dips in its manufacturing output numbers, partly due to slower exports to the West. </p><p>\"The Chinese government, to be sure, has been taking steps to rein in speculative bubbles especially in real estate but, at the same time, not unwind too rapidly by managing a soft landing. It has the benefit of a buffer of sizeable reserves to ensure it maintains its steady state growth momentum,\" says Flood.</p><p>Further indications of what Beijing had in its monetary arsenal was evident when the Chinese central bank moved quickly on Dec 1 last year to cut domestic banks’ reserve requirements which added about 370 billion yuan (S$58 billion) to the financial system on news of the first contraction in manufacturing output since February 2009. According to most economists, the Chinese authorities still have room for further cuts to support growth if needed.</p><p><b>Warning: Headwinds Ahead</b></p><p>But despite these mitigating factors in Asia, storm clouds from the West will always be looming over the horizon in the coming months.</p><p>For instance, the inability of US politicians to come up with a compromise on the national budget will likely put a dent in both investor and consumer confidence once automatic cuts in government spending kicks in. European policymakers will also need to step up to the plate to fend off fears of the contagion effect fanning across from Greece to Italy, Spain and maybe even France.</p><p>Notes Vasu Menon, Vice-President for Wealth Management at OCBC Bank and a member of the OCBC Wealth Panel: \"There will be the possibility of more ratings downgrade of European banks and even some sovereign debts losing their top-tier AAA ratings, which may hurt their ability to raise funds.\"</p><p>\"In the meantime, both European and US banks will be looking to re-capitalise and restructure their balance sheets. These will put a crimp on lending while governments are also in consolidation mode, which will have knock-on effects on Asia, which is not totally decoupled from Western economies.\"</p><p>For now, the market outlook over the next few months looks set to be dominated by the Euro debt crisis and how policymakers respond to keep the Euro zone intact. What is encouraging, says Flood, is that European Union (EU) members have reiterated that breaking up is not an option.</p><p>He adds that closer \"fiscal integration\" may be the likely outcome, which may result in a transfer of some budgetary powers from local states to the EU. In turn, the EU will become more involved in national budgets with pre-emptive mechanisms to correct imbalances. </p><p>Says Flood: \"Our main concern regarding Europe is not so much the macro environment but the impact on global credit conditions due to the European banks’ need to raise capital requirements.\"</p><p>\"The US, on the other hand, seems to remain at a crossroad. This is likely to continue into early 2012. Further compounding the situation is the lack of consensus in America amongst the political elite as to what would be the policies going forward.\"</p><p><b>New Normal In The Global Economy</b></p><p>These developments are emblematic of a \"new international order\", observes Menon. \"What we are witnessing now is not a mere passing phase, but rather a new phase in a new international order due to deep-rooted problems characterised by a mountain of debts in both in Europe and the US.\"</p>	<p>\"It will take not a mere few months or even a few quarters but years to wring out the excesses and rectify the underlying public debts. The headwinds are structural. There are no quick fixes, no magic bullets.\"</p><p>The silver lining is that current global stock valuations are not expensive with price earnings (PE) ratios in the single digits to low-teens versus mid-to high-teens normally. </p><p>Given the current climate, Lion Global Investors favour Asian corporate credit and Asian high dividend equities, which are seen as best positioned to benefit from the good fundamentals and growth potential in the region while providing relatively more stable returns.</p><p>Menon also notes that bonds which were not often seen as sexy investments will clearly have a place in investor portfolios in the current climate, especially with yields of some corporate bonds at around 3 to 4 per cent.</p><p>With the huge liquidity of more than US$16 trillion on the sidelines in the region, any pullbacks should spell opportunities to re-enter the equities markets for those with a strong risk appetite and a medium term horizon. Investors, he adds, would however be wise to tone down their expectations to 7 to 8 per cent region per annum over the medium term.</p><p>\"The volatility in global markets we have seen over the past 12 to 18 months is not typical of market cycles we had experienced in the past in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s.\"</p><p>\"Making gains of 20 to 30 per cent on a sustainable basis is going to be a tough feat in this new normal phase. We can expect the global economy to grow at a more moderate pace with Asia taking the lead ahead of Western and developed economies. </p><p>\"There may not be a global recession unless the situation in the Euro area spirals out of control, but a recovery, when it kicks in, may not be very strong either. But for investors, it pays to diversify and be defensive. Seek out valued stocks that pay higher dividends and buy more prudently in a staggered manner especially on dips in the market,\" says Menon.</p><p>The commodity sector is another alternative area for investors to consider due to growing demand from emerging markets in the longer term, according to Lion Global Investors.</p><p>\"We like oil due to tightening stocks; natural gas in the longer-term due to strong market demand; thermal coal in the near-term due to supply shortfalls caused by infrastructure bottlenecks; copper and nickel as the market is fundamentally tight; as well as palm oil because the grains market is historically tight and there is price upside risk in the near-term,\" notes Flood.</p><p>As for gold, Menon remains positive about its medium term outlook. The demand for gold from institutional investors (like Asian central banks) and affluent individuals in Asia is on the rise, while its supply is limited. However, he cautions that the rise in gold price may not be as strong going forward after the sharp run-up in recent years. Also there are risks, as any improvements in the macroeconomic outlook could boost investors’ risk appetite from time to time and weigh on the price of the precious metal. </p><p>\"Gold price was highly volatile last year and investors must brace themselves for a roller-coaster ride this year as well,\" says Menon. He adds that to reduce risk, investors should limit their gold investments to no more than 10 per cent of their total portfolio. </p>";

What he probably did not count on was how his OE has been going on for almost 22 years and counting. </p><p>Flood smiles at the suggestion, but reveals that he would not have it any other way. Tracing his experiences out of New Zealand, Flood says that his overseas stints have taken him to London, Hong Kong and Singapore – and given him invaluable insights to the world of investments and life in general. </p><p>He also felt that he was privileged to be \"at the right place at the right time\", which allowed him to experience first-hand the world’s most dynamic markets in the throes of their development.</p><p>Moving to London in 1989 while \"not knowing a lot about asset management\", he cut his teeth working for Mercury Asset Management, now part of Black Rock. It was about the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall and he said the event – and the ensuing rise of the European markets – had a huge impact on him as a young investment manager. </p><p>\"It opened my eyes to the kind of changes that were possible both on a professional and societal level,\" he recounts. \"Seeing the wall come down, Europe opening up, the launch of the Euro currency and the move towards an equity culture – the events that I witnessed in the rapid evolution of Europe were tremendous.\"</p><p>Flood’s 15 years in London, in which he held several key investment roles within the company’s equity division, only served to feed his hunger for exploring new markets, which he found in Asia. </p><p>From London, he moved to Hong Kong in 2004, first serving as MLIM’s COO for its Asian markets, and then as an executive director at Imprimatur Capital, an early-stage private equity firm. In 2009, Singapore beckoned, where he has been with Lion Global Investors as its Chief Investment Officer and investment committee chairman for the past three years. </p><p>\"What makes Asia so exciting is that the people here recognise the opportunities that they have and are going after them enthusiastically,\" he says. \"I love Asia’s fantastic work ethic; it starts when people are very young and it goes all the way through to old age and is prevalent at all levels of the society. There are no shortcuts and people understand that here.\"</p><p>Flood says his self-professed pragmatism and enthusiasm sit comfortably with the Asian work ethic. For one, he claims to \"never really switch off\", putting in the hours simply because he loves his work. He also finds his move to Asia serendipitous, especially at a time when the world’s financial powers are shifting in a geographic sense. </p><p>\"I think I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to witness first hand and play a part in the changes taking place in Asia. Just being a part of what is Asia’s moment in time fascinates me. Previously, Asia was where people go for vacations. But Asia is now where people do business. Here is where the growth is,\" he says.</p><p>While Flood is enthused by the opportunities in Asian markets, he says that his experience in the finance industry has taught him that cool-headed logic should always prevail in making informed investment decisions.</p><p>\"Being in this business for so long gives us perspective. It teaches us that nothing goes on in a straight line forever. When things go right, you start thinking about what could possibly go wrong. When it’s the opposite, you think about a good time to get back into the market,\" he reasons. \"And you rely on the people around you and the structures that you put in place. You don’t ever rely on luck.\"</p><p>When quizzed about the parallels that he could draw from the world of investments to daily living, Flood again stresses the importance of being pragmatic and exercising common sense.</p><p>\"There are several life lessons to be learnt from investing. The first is to understand your limitations. Second, always be disciplined and not get carried away with things. Third, always be calm in the face of challenges. And finally,\" he advises, \"it always pays to be realistic. If someone tells you something that is too good to be true, it probably is. One needs to be level-headed enough to know there is no such thing as a free lunch.\" </p>";

							var wealth2_content = "<p>As a second-generation member of the family behind Cortina Holdings, its chief operating officer Jeremy Lim gives top priority to preserving the public-listed company dealing in fine watches.</p><p>\"If my father had not worked so hard to set up the business, where would the three of us siblings be? We would have nothing,\" says the 40-year-old, whose older brother and sister are also active in the business that their father Anthony Lim started in 1972 as a small retail shop. \"So we are all in agreement that we should safeguard the family business, otherwise we would let him down terribly and everything our father created would be gone.\"</p><p>After Jeremy Lim completed his studies in finance and accountancy in Australia, he worked as an auditor at a bank for several years. When the economy was in the doldrums in 1997, he found bad debts aplenty at the bank and discovered that many companies had failed to secure their fundamentals, causing them to have insufficient funds and inadequate liquidity. This meant that any fluctuation in exchange rates or turnover led to cash flow problems that were not easy to resolve. These case studies provided valuable real-life lessons in financial management to Lim, who joined Cortina in 2000.</p><p>Says Lim: \"Whatever the company makes this year, a fixed percentage is distributed as dividends to shareholders and the rest goes into our reserve. We don’t spend everything we make. It is essential to retain capital reserves because it’s impossible for the company to do well every year and we need to take preventive measures. It becomes even more important to manage capital well in bad times in order to sail through difficult periods.\"</p><p>When the financial crisis hit in 2008, all 210 Cortina employees in Asia kept their jobs, but were required to take days off and had their bonuses reduced, until the market recovered. Lim points out that in recent years, financial storms seem to happen on a yearly basis and no one can predict when the next one will happen. All the more his company should work on strengthening the fundamentals and managing business operations well, he feels. This way, the business can stay in the pink of health even if the economy tanks next year; if things swing the other way, the returns would be even higher.</p><p>Lim is responsible for Cortina’s business in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, overseeing the shops, sales and purchasing, and human resource; his brother Raymond is in charge of retail in Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong, while sister Sharon covers distribution. The division of responsibilities is clear and the siblings meet often to talk shop.</p><p>As there is no one to push the boss, he has to push himself, says Lim, who has turned self-encouragement into a habit. \"I have to perform my duties well; it’s bad when my family has words with me.\"</p><p>The luxury business has unique needs and wants that often determine how well a company will perform, Lim shares. It is important to be tactile – phone calls will not suffice when meetings are possible – and sensitive. A boutique in Hong Kong would display half the number of fine watches than a store of the same size in Singapore, for example, because Hong Kong’s crowds need the room to throng. Personalised services and customisation are in too.</p><p>It is also important to read one’s customer base correctly. Customers from mainland China are the lifeblood of the Hong Kong retail business these days, but in Singapore, they form only half the number of people walking in – the other half comes from Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Lim says: \"Sales to mainland Chinese customers will only boost our business. It won’t determine our survival.\" </p><p><b>The Key To Happiness</b></p><p>Being steeped in the luxury watch business makes watch collecting a natural hobby to Lim but it is not an investment tool. He feels that with two young daughters aged six and seven, investments with lower risks, such as unit trusts, life and endowment insurance, are more appropriate. </p><p>His main avenue of wealth accumulation has been real-estate investment. Lim feels that any time is a good time to buy property in Singapore because the resource is scarce land and the population is growing. Considerable appreciation in value is almost certain after holding on to the properties and renting them out for five, 10 or even 20 years, he opines. Lim reveals that the private condominium properties in his portfolio are turning in a rental yield of 8 per cent. He also has the option of selling or leaving them to his children. </p><p>To him, wealth is about contentment and not about raking in the big bucks. He says: \"Live within your means. If you make a lot, you can spend a lot; when you make very little, spend very little. The most important thing is to be content. If you’re not, you’ll never be happy.\" </p>";

And when you do, a sense of dread seeps in.</span></p><p><span>This happens for two reasons. The first is that any talk on retirement inevitably dredges up images of a lifestyle that has been pared down to fit a more austere budget. The second is that successful people prefer not to think about the loss of responsibility and stature that accompanies retirement. </span></p><p><span>Fortunately, these latent fears can be alleviated by good retirement planning, where the right knowledge and actions prevail. A few tips on the topic came out of a recent dinner conversation and if you can apply these to your life, then your retirement should be a golden one.</span></p><p/><p><span><b>• Anticipate Longevity</b></span></p><p><span>The first concern you should have is also something to be desired – longevity. The challenge of living a life that is rich and long is that it comes at a cost. </span></p><p><span>The first and most obvious cost is the cost of living and, dare I say, living well. If you are used to dining in fine restaurants, travelling overseas every year and using the facilities of a country club, factor these into your budget. They are what make your life enjoyable now – imagine how much more so when you have more time to burn?</span></p><p><span>The second cost is that of inflation and you need to factor into your retirement budget somewhat more than the government’s statistical inflation rate of 2 per cent. The challenge here is to continue to maintain a diversified investment portfolio while ensuring you have access to cash.</span></p><p><span><b>• Prepare For The Inevitable</b></span></p><p><span>The biggest risk in anticipating longevity is being right but not planning for it. However, ensuring that your assets and wealth outlasts your needs presents a different problem – where does it go when you are gone?</span></p><p><span>A well-thought-out and administered estate plan is the best way to achieve to ensure your wishes are followed when you are not around.</span></p><p><span>In order to leave wealth to your beneficiaries and to live well, you need to have sufficient funds to do both, say, by putting in place a funding strategy such as through a life insurance policy. </span></p><p><span><b>• Plan For The Unexpected</b></span></p><p><span>Despite our best intentions and actions, life can deal some crushing blows to our plans. Illness, natural disasters and market downturns can all detract from the wealth we have. By anticipating the unexpected, you can prepare for this eventuality by planning to leave a liquid estate created instantly on demise through the use of an insurance policy. </span></p><p/><p><span>Whether you live a long and healthy life, or whether your party plans for your 100th birthday are thwarted by fate, it pays to take steps to ensure that your impending retirement does not plague you with worries about living too long, dying too soon or not properly leaving behind an estate that is reflective of your life’s work. The first step is to talk to your financial advisor and perform a review of your current retirement and estate plan.</span></p>";

								var kot_indulgence_content = "<b><p><b>The Japanese luxury marque revs up its engine for its debut in Singapore with three models </b></p><p><b>TEXT Chew Chen Yang</b></p></b><p>It is one of the greatest ironies in life, but luxury and performance do not always come together −think of your favourite pair of hand-crafted leather brogues and your next marathon. But with Japanese carmaker Infiniti, yin and yang can and do co-exist.</p><p>The luxury marque with a history of over 20 years mixes its innate Japanese talent for no-nonsense precision engineering with a commitment to the finer things.</p><p>When the 9,900 sq ft Infiniti showroom opens at 45 Leng Kee Road before Chinese New Year, Singaporeans who want a Japanese luxury sedan will not have just the Lexus to turn to. Infiniti hopes to lure customers who want a more sporty and engaging drive without sacrificing creature comforts. </p><p>\"We’re looking at drivers who are not just talking about power, but the engagement of driving,\" says the Infiniti spokesman.</p><p>So what exactly is the Infiniti brand? It is Nissan’s premium range (yes, the same way a Lexus is a high-end Toyota) that goes beyond cosmetic luxury. Infiniti does not merely amp up the trims on a Nissan Murano SUV and declare it a sport Crossover, for example. Instead, the intelligent all-wheel drive FX37 is based on a totally different platform from the Murano.</p><p>In Singapore, the Infiniti brand will be distributed by Wearnes Automotive, which distributes other luxury and high-end makes including Bentley and McLaren.</p><p>Wearnes will bring in three Infiniti models – M37 sedan, G-Convertible and FX37 crossover – that will all be \"fully loaded\" and bristling with technology, so expect the price tags to match.</p><p>All three are powered by the much-vaunted VQ37 six-cylinder engine that enthusiasts might recognise as the same engine deployed in the Nissan 370Z. It produces a velvety smooth 320hp at 7,000rpm and is matched with a seven-speed automatic transmission. For FX owners that need even more power, Infiniti Singapore offers the FX50 with a 5-litre V8 engine at 390hp and 500Nm.</p><p><b>Key technological features available in Infiniti models sold in Singapore include:</b></p><p>• Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which detects low-frequency engine harmonics in the cabin and generates acoustically opposite sound waves to cancel out the engine sounds. ANC uses the woofer component of the four-door speakers and the 10-inch woofer on vehicles equipped with Bose audio system to generate the sound waves. The sound waves are in opposite phase to the undesirable engine sounds to be cancelled. ANC monitors engine speed to ensure that the system cancels only undesirable engine sounds and is fine-tuned using two interior microphones. It is standard on the M37 sedan.</p><p>• The Around View Monitor, which is more than just a rear camera. It uses four exterior cameras to paint a 360-deg birds’ eye view to help you see all around your FX SUV. No more guessing how far you are from the wall or if there is a child playing hide-and-seek near you.</p><p>• Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC), which will be standard on the M37, FX37 and G-Convertible. This technology helps you automatically slow down as you approach traffic and maintain a safe distance from the car in front.</p><p>• Lane Departure Prevention (LDP), which if the vehicle veers from its lane, will apply brakes to the correct wheel to help move the vehicle back into the lane. Available on the M37 and FX37.</p><p>• Intelligent Brake Assist (IBA), with forward collision warning on the M37 and FX37.</p><p>• Blind Spot Intervention (BSI), that warns the driver changing lanes of a car in the blind spot and then helps you get back in the lane if the warning is ignored. Available on the M37.</p><p>• 4WAS or Four-Wheel Active Steer, which endows the M37 sport sedan with sports-car-like handling by steering the rear wheels. Sensors monitor the driver’s steering input and vehicle speed, before the front steering ratio and the angle of the rear wheels are adjusted according to the conditions. When changing lanes quickly, 4WAS momentarily changes the path of the front and rear wheels to help move the vehicle where you steer it. </p><p>Driving an Infiniti is more than just climbing aboard a luxury car and getting transported to your destination. </p><p>\"Inspired technology is the innovative heart of Inspired Performance\" goes Infiniti’s slogan. Injecting even more panache and excitement into future Infiniti models is the brand’s tie-up with two-time F1 world champions, the Red Bull Racing Team. Besides the trickling down of technology garnered from racing in the pinnacle of motorsports, Red Bull’s World Championship driver Sebastian Vettel has also been actively giving his input on special Infiniti models. One such car is the 414hp Infiniti FX Sebastian Vettel Version that was first shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show last September. Rumour has it that it will make it to production.</p><p>Infiniti may be a new brand outside of North America, but with its stellar credentials, not to mention over 500 million people watching F1 every year, Infiniti may soon become a household name in Singapore. </p>";

This year, over 30 years after his death, a tribute to that vision has been achieved.</span></p><p><span>Ultimate Adornments is Harry Winston’s latest collection, which draws inspiration from the neckline of female clothing. Each piece is a perfect embodiment of feminine grace and luxurious elegance, and a step closer to Harry Winston’s dream to dress a woman purely in diamonds. </span></p><p><span>The collection of 40 pieces, with each piece costing between US$30,000 (S$38,600) and US$6 million, took 1½ years to create, with some pieces requiring 1,000 hours of setting work to put platinum and top-grade diamonds together with meticulous craftsmanship.</span></p><p><span>In the creation of this extraordinary collection, the Harry Winston design team looked to the brand’s archives for inspiration.</span></p><p><span>Who should largely inspire them but the late Ambaji V. Shinde, its chief jewellery designer?</span></p><p><span>From 1962 to 2001, Shinde drew from his own Indian aristocratic heritage to produce dazzling jewellery for Harry Winston’s global clients. His most significant contribution to the brand had been his exceptional artistry as well as his ability to work his observations of the world around him into spellbinding creations. </span></p><p><span>That international perspective and unique interpretation of Harry Winston’s hallmark elegant style became the creative catalyst for the house’s latest Ultimate Adornments collection, comprising seven series of all-new jewellery pieces that reflect different cultures and themes. </span></p><p><span>The Qipao theme,for example, reflects motifs in the traditional costumes of Chinese culture.</span></p><p><span>The collection is the largest in Harry Winston’s 80-year history. In another first, Harry Winston chose to launch the collection in Shanghai, China – the first time the brand has premiered a collection outside of the United States.</span></p><p><span>The choice of China for the international debut of the Ultimate Adornments collection is symbolic of how much the market means to the brand, says Frederic de Narp, CEO of Harry Winston.</span></p><p><span>\"We first showed US$150 million worth of jewellery at the Forbidden City back in 1996. Our Chinese clients already have a deep knowledge of Harry Winston,\" he says in Shanghai at the launch event, where he announced the opening of two flagship stores in China in three months. The one in Shanghai’s Xin Tian Di will be its largest in the world.</span></p><p><span>Asked which Ultimate Adornments series he found the most outstanding, De Narp picked the Mrs. Winston. Why? \"It is the set that is closest to the concept of ‘attaching the diamonds directly onto a woman’s skin’.\"</span></p><p><span>Mrs. Winston</span></p><p><span>This series is dedicated to Edna, the wife of the brand’s <br/>founder Harry Winston. It is a perfect combination of Mrs. Winston’s personal style as well as the Winston’s <br/>vision of attaching diamonds directly onto a woman’s <br/>skin. The diamonds hang seamlessly and naturally from a portrait-style neckline. The most stunning among the series is the Mrs. Winston bracelet, featuring more than 175 diamonds of a total of 45.51 carats; the Mrs. Winston necklace features a similar design with more than 180 carats of flawless diamonds.</span></p><p><span>此系列作品是品牌创办人海瑞温斯顿献给其挚爱的夫人爱德娜（Edna）的，完美融合温斯顿夫人的个人风格与温斯顿欲将钻石镶嵌于肌肤上的梦想，钻石紧密贴合颈部曲线向下延伸。系列中最令人赞叹的作品是温斯顿夫人手环，精选超过175颗、总重高达45.51克拉的顶级钻石镶嵌而成；该系列另有设计相同的Mrs. Winston钻石项链，选用超过180克拉完美无瑕钻石打造。</span></p><p><span>Caftan</span></p><p><span>The drawings of Ambaji Shinde, former chief designer of Harry Winston, inspired this series, which stands out for its extraordinarily intricate design and striking lines, re-defining the exoticism and exquisite elegance of traditional Indian caftans. The centrepieces of this series are the two gorgeous Caftan diamond necklaces. Four different kinds of settings are used – channel-set, prong-set, bezel-set and pave – for the entirely handcrafted pieces. The genius and flair of the craftsman adds an exquisite texture and comfort, giving the elegant style full expression.</span></p><p><span>创作灵感取自前首席珠宝设计师辛德的设计手稿，以非凡的设计、极美的线条比例重新诠释传统印度服饰的异国风情与细腻优雅。主打款式为两款风格非凡的Caftan钻石项链，采用4种不同钻石镶嵌法，排列镶嵌、爪镶、包镶与密钉镶嵌，全由技艺巧夺天工的珠宝工匠悉心以手工镶制，增添细腻触感及配戴舒适度，尽显优雅。</span></p><p><span>Qipao</span></p><p><span>The qipao is the clothing most evocative of China in recent times. It was all the rage in Shanghai during the 1920s and the dress encompasses the finest details of tailoring and form. Each piece in the series incorporates different techniques of diamond setting in elegant and perfect design, including the use of meticulously calibrated diamonds to forge perfect circular shapes. The extravagantly beautiful diamond cuff has a tailored fit and features more than 700 diamonds. It captures the precise tailoring and form of the qipao and its delicate elegance. </span></p><p><span>旗袍是近代最具代表性的中国服饰，风靡于1920年代的上海，代表对服装剪裁细腻与样式精致的讲究。此系列每件作品皆结合不同钻石镶嵌工法，设计极为雅致，包括大量采用经细心挑选的宝石，辅以极精密的专业切割工技术，打造出完美的圆形明亮式切割钻石。华丽绝美的Qipao钻石手环拥有如裁缝般量身打造的贴合度，以超过700颗钻石精确捕捉旗袍的剪裁结构所带来的风华。</span></p><p><span>Deel</span></p><p><span>The deel is a traditional Mongolian dress, known for its structured tailoring and unique button fastenings. To realise the full effect of its folded collars, the craftsmen have carefully re-cut and re-calibrated channel-set baguettes to place the diamonds closer to one another. The proximity brings out their brilliance while their edges remain separate. The setting turns the diamond’s <br/>traditionally straight shape into surprising fluid lines. These techniques and stunning craftsmanship are embodied perfectly in the small Deel diamond necklace, featuring more than 315 diamonds with a total of 86.85 carats.</span></p><p><span>Deel是蒙古传统服饰之一，以其结构性剪裁与钮扣开襟等特色广为人知。为真实呈现其褶领效果，工匠小心翼翼地重新切工并校准每颗钻石之间的距离，让钻石之间相互辉映出最绚烂的光彩却又不能彼此碰触，巧妙地将传统钻石直线式的排列镶嵌转化为令人激赏的流线线条。以总重达86.85克拉、超过315颗钻石精心打造而成的小型Deel钻石项链，是极致工艺的完美典范。</span></p><p><span>Draperie</span></p><p><span>Inspired by the shimmering brilliance of a line of diamonds, this series captures the retro glamour of a bygone era through the natural and gentle drape of the necklaces and bracelets reminiscent of a sequinned scarf. The 560 diamonds of the Draperie necklace is prong-set individually, creating a natural fluid effect while showcasing the dazzling beauty of the stones in motion.</span></p><p><span>创作灵感来自钻石排列成串时瞬间跃动的璀璨闪耀。此系列项链与手链像是缀满闪烁亮片的围巾，拥有柔软自然的垂坠感，唤醒一种复古情怀。共镶嵌560颗钻石，个别以爪式镶工法固定，创造出配戴时的舒适度，并显现珠宝最大律动的绚丽美感。</span></p><p/><p><span>Queen</span></p><p><span>The Queen of Lace is Harry Winston’s flagship piece and its interpretation of elegance. Each top-grade diamond is meticulously hand-set in the intricately complicated style of Point d’Alençon, a styling design which has been designated a Unesco World Heritage. The Queen necklace features round brilliant diamonds totaling 100 carats, emanating the feminine elegance of an enchanting collar, the perfect embellishment for a woman’s grace and charm.</span></p><p><span>The Queen of Lace由工匠悉心以手工仔细镶嵌每颗精选的顶级钻石，完美设计出如入选世界文化遗产的法国阿朗松针织花边（Point d&apos;Alençon）般错综复杂的艺术品。由总重近100克拉的圆形明亮式切割钻石打造的Queen钻石项链，宛如女性优雅迷人的领型，突显女性的妩媚。</span></p><p/><p><span>Guipure</span></p><p><span>Floral motifs are realised with closely set and complicated pave diamonds, which are then interwoven to create a layered feel, evoking the intricateness of Guipure lace. The dazzling diamond floral motifs and the layered effect add a dimensionality and fluidity to the necklaces. The Guipure necklace, with 50 carats of diamonds, is exemplary of the series’ magnificence.  </span></p><p><span>将精选的顶级钻石经由缜密复杂的镶嵌技艺排列成花朵图样，运用钻石相互交织成立体层次感，打造出细致度仿如Guipure蕾丝般的绝美工艺。耀眼夺目的钻石花朵图样，精心地层层镶叠，为每条项链增添立体感与灿动美态，其中以镶嵌超过50克拉钻石打造而成的Guipure钻石项链最令人惊艳。</span></p>";

								var kotH_content = "<b><p><span>Hermes releases the world’s first triple retrograde watch, a timepiece that encourages its owners to get playful with time, even stop it at will </span><br/>TEXT NG KING KANG / 吴庆康</span></p><p><span>PHOTO Hermès</span></p></b><p>One day, in a suburb of Beijing near the Badaling Great Wall area, Le Montre Hermès suspended time. </p><p>It happened like this: Hermès was launching a watch, Arceau Le Temps Suspendu, with a \"magical function\"; once the button at nine o’clock is pressed, the minute and hour hands jumps into a V formation between 11.30 and 12.30, and the date indicator goes into hiding. Nothing moves till you feel like restoring time and, in the process, time is paused. </p><p>While time is suspended on the face of the watch, its mechanism is still working covertly. The next time the button is pressed, the watch resumes indicating the right time and date.</p><p>Through this interesting and seemingly simple action, a highly complicated and intricate mechanism – with clever cams, ingenious gears and a deflector – enables a wearer to forget about time. That is, civilian time is given pause through concealment, so a different sense of time is presented. </p><p>The watch neatly sums up the French luxury house’s philosophy of \"letting Hermès take us on a time to dream\", says Luc Perramond, CEO of Hermès. \"Last year was the crucial point in our development of the Time To Dream concept. We were forging new frontiers based on a very special and avant-garde technology in order to enchant our clients.\" </p><p>To this end, the brand sought out Jean-Marc Wiederrecht, a top watchmaker known for his fantastical imagination, to create a mechanical interpretation of its poetic ambition. </p><p>What resulted 3½ years later was the world’s first time suspension module, the Agenhor module consisting of 140 parts, which enables time to be suspended and changed at will with a single-button control of the hour, minute and date hands. The module now sits in the world’s first triple retrograde watch. </p><p>With Arceau Le Temps Suspendu, the phases between normal operation and a suspension of time are coordinated by two parallel synchronised gears – one controlling the hands of the watch and the other controlling the date indicator. An additional module enables the watch to shift between the two times. The mechanism has two patents: one for its structural design and the other for its play-reducing gear teeth.</p><p>The unique watch was awarded the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève for best men’s watch in November last year. Wiederrecht is no stranger to awards: With Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, he had bagged the same prize for best ladies’ watch in 2010 with the Lovers’ Bridge wristwatch. </p><p>At the Arceau Le Temps Suspendu global launch in China, Hermès set up a \"surrealistic\" scene at the flying club near the Badaling Great Wall in Beijing, to create a realistic sense of the unrealistic suspension of time. On a field, a number of installations were built around the same theme of time suspension, featuring masked wanderers, ballerinas, fishermen, divers, a wooden horse and a hot air balloon. All the installations harked back to the Arceau’s theme of A Time To Dream.</p><p>At once symbolic and in accordance to the event’s theme was how guests were asked to leave their time-telling devices such as wristwatches and mobile phones at the door, a move that set the mood for leaving time behind.</p><p>Arceau Time Suspendu illustrates Hermès’ new definition of time, especially pertinent in an era where we are all controlled by time. While it may seem fancy, the philosophy and spirit behind the design cater both to practicality and fun.</p><p>Likewise, another Hermès watch, the Cape God Grand Hours, demonstrates the relativity of time with six different speeds, according to whether the wearer wants time to pass more quickly or slowly, thus creating the illusion of control over time. A traditional time display is abandoned in favour of a dial with unevenly spaced numerals and a rhythm inspired by musical movement to create customised views of how time passes. </p><p>Time may seem immutable and untameable, but in the world of Hermès, where time can be ingenuously suspended, this is not necessarily true – time may even become a compliant friend. With these mechanical interpretations of poetry, Hermès shares a time to dream. </p>";

								var kotG_content = "<p><b>Ancient Wisdom For Modern Cooks</b></p><p><b>Use What You Have</b></p><p>Celebrity chefs such as Ferran Adrià, Joel Robuchon, Heston Blumenthal, Paul Bocuse and Thomas Keller all share the same unsung hero in the kitchen – the sous vide cooker. </p><p>Sous vide is a method of cooking that involves sealing food in a plastic bag and then immersing in a water bath. Sous vide cookers offer precise temperature control (normally at 60 deg C) and the food is cooked over a period as long as 72 hours, for the juices to be preserved. </p>	<p>How were the same dishes done before sous vide came along? In place of expensive gadgets and cutting edge technology was the humble pig bladder.</p><p>Poularde en vessie, or chicken in bladder, is a traditional dish from Lyon, found rarely in restaurants even in its native France. Périgord truffle is stuffed into the space between the skin and flesh of a young Bresse hen, which is marinated with brandy, Madeira or other alcohol and then stuffed into a pig bladder and sewn shut. It is then slowly cooked by bathing with chicken stock. </p><p>Julien Royer, the head chef of the restaurant Jaan, says: \"Because of the length of the cooking process, many seemingly simple but complex techniques are not well-understood and so this Lyon specialty is uncommon even in Paris. For example, the bladder needs to be treated with white vinegar and cold water to rid it of the odour – this process alone takes 24 to 48 hours.\"</p><p>Another aspect of the dish that can be considered old-fashioned is that it has to be eaten when it is ready, he adds. \"Poularde en vessie cannot be pre-cooked as the chicken will dry out very quickly, so it has to be prepared just before it is served. Diners have to wait at least one and a half hours after ordering before they can eat it – this is tradition. It’s also why the French only take their time to savour the dish during special occasions.\"</p><p><b>Eat What You Have</b></p><p>Culinary culture is borne of history, culture, customs and, very often, necessity. This was how pig trotters made its way into Italian menus, when a war forced the people to turn whatever food resources they had into a meal.</p><p>In 1510, the \"Warrior\" Pope Giulio II had besieged the city of Modena for aligning itself with Venice, thus cutting off its food supply. Pigs’ trotters are not usually eaten by Italians, but they decided to find a way to best prepare it in order to fill their stomachs. That was when someone came up with the idea of removing the bone from the pigs’ forelegs and stuffing them with fatty ground pork, pork rind and spices. And thus, zampone was born.</p><p>The dish became a local specialty and is listed as a Protected Geographical Indication (that is, under European Union law, its origins as a regional dish is protected). Mario Caramella of the Italian restaurant Forlino says: \"Often, people are forced to make their best contributions through necessity. Zampone came about like that: it came out of need and so it has a solid substance to it, becoming more flavourful over time. It’s an outstanding Italian creation.\"</p><p><b>Replace What You Do Not Have</b></p><p>While the Italians’ storied creation of the zampone involved eating up all that you have, Indonesia’s gudeg was borne out of not having the real thing to begin with.</p><p>The traditional jackfruit stew, which originated from Yogyakarta and central Java, is rich in protein and flushed with an earthy taste. The Javanese were too poor to afford beef and so came up with the idea of replacing the meat with young jackfruit, which has a similar texture to beef. </p><p>Without fridges to preserve food, gudeg was prepared with minimal stirring to lessen the introduction of air, which causes food to spoil easily. Alicia Tivey, chef at Indonesian restaurant The Moluccas Room, says: \"The ancient way does not require complex techniques; it purely involves simmering un-ripened jackfruit with herbs, spices and coconut milk over a low wood fire for two to three days until all the moisture as been absorbed by the jackfruit, which becomes naturally softened.\"</p><p>Tivey says the most unusual aspect of the traditional recipe is the use of teak leaves to cover the clay pot, which prevent the flesh from being burnt during the three-day cooking process.</p><p><b>Preserve What You Have</b></p><p>The cuisine of each civilisation has its classic and distinctive flavour, and Middle Eastern cuisine is no different. Its dishes stay true to tradition till today, featuring a unique taste that deftly combines the simple ingredients of olive oil, garlic and coriander. One traditional home-style dish that showcases this flavour best is bazella bel rezz, or green pea stew with short beef ribs.</p><p>This dish is commonly found in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Palestine. During the Ottoman reign in 17th century Middle East, the sultan’s Turkish cooks discovered green peas and used them with carrots and other vegetables to cook beef short ribs. </p><p>Khaled Amori, the chef of Middle Eastern restaurant Anar Singapore, says: \"To create the most distinctive taste, the traditional method calls for the beef to be cooked on the bone, to add a local flavour. In the Middle East, we use a large copper pot, 70cm across and 85cm tall, or a clay pot, and simmer it over a charcoal stove. Because copper utensils are used, the food will not be burnt. If you can’t finish all the food on the first day, it becomes even more flavourful on the second day.\"</p><p><b>Enrich What You Have</b></p><p>As was the case in royal courts and dining traditions of days past, when a banquet calls for the rendering of some exquisite dishes, bring out the game. </p><p>In China, turtle was a prized game meat in ancient Guangxi, granted by the emperor as a reward to generals who had been victorious in war. During the reign of Emperor Qianlong in the Qing dynasty, turtle meat was prepared with winter shoots and mushrooms in the Guibei region. </p><p>Chef Liu Ching Hai of the Summer Palace restaurant at Regent Hotel Singapore first came across the traditional recipe for braised whole turtle during his apprenticeship in Hong Kong; he reprises it at the Regent in all its ancient glory. </p><p>No fancy equipment is needed for this dish either. Rather, the selection and treatment of the turtle meat is key: Medium-sized turtles bred in Malaysia are chosen for their smooth flesh, soft bones and thick chewy sides to produce a gamey and yet delicate flavour. The game can be rendered tender by draining the meat of blood. \"The rinsing step is all-important: the traditional way is to slaughter it cleanly and clear out the intestines and shell,\" he explains. \"Then rinse it with boiling water followed by a soak in cold water, before peeling off the membranes and paring the thick shell.\"</p><p>Another secret: It is essential to watch the fire closely for this dish: If the fire is too high, the collagen will be burnt; the overcooked turtle will also become stringy.</p>";

								var wheels_content = "	<p><b><span>With retro looks straight out of the 1920s and futuristic technology befitting the 21st century,the new Morgan 3 Wheeler redefines nostalgia<br /></span><span>TEXT NG KING KANG / 吴庆康</span></b> </p><p>At the mention of nostalgia in the motoring world, the stalwart Morgan, a luxury Brit carmaker, comes to mind. Established in 1906, the family business was the first to launch a sports car at the dawn of the last century. Morgan places high value on details and fine craftsmanship, as well as pure power, and makes very few cars a year. But the biggest draw of its products is the stylishly retro designs that hark back to the 1920s.</p><p>At the recent Geneva Auto Show, Morgan unveiled its first all-new 3 Wheeler model in 58 years, with the requisite retro design. The car is slated to go into production this year. Morgan launched its first three-wheeler back in 1909, powered by a V2 engine; some 30,000 such vehicles were produced between then and 1953. In the same era, Ford also developed a 32hp four-stroke engine for three-wheeled cars, but Morgan’s V2 engine prevailed as the classic.</p><p>The 3 Wheeler of 2012 has kept its classic bullet form, but significant upgrades have been made to materials, capacity and engine power. This new two-seat three-wheeler has a design based on what the brand calls a \"race on Sunday\" philosophy: the interior is made to resemble a cockpit, with aircraft-type seats and instrument panel, complete with a starter designed to look like a bomb-release button. Morgan claims these design details add to \"the sense of flying on the road\". Leather padded seats complement a reinforced tubular chassis of aluminium, with twin roll bars for driver and passenger to ensure safety.</p><p>The 3 Wheeler is powered by a 2-litre V Twin engine developed by S & S, paired with a Mazda five-speed gearbox that can direct power to the sole rear wheel. Maximum power is 115hp, acceleration from 0 to 100kmh is 4.5 seconds and top speed is 185kmh – specs that seal the car’s position as the world’s fastest three-wheeler. </p><p>With a total weight of just 500kg, Morgan’s 3 Wheeler comes with classic Avon MK II65 series front tyres of 19 by 4 inches. In the rear, a R16 87V uni-directional tread tyre measuring 19.5 by 5.5 inches is used, adding a contemporary touch to the vehicle. </p><p>In the tradition of Morgan, the new 3 Wheeler also comes with a slew of customisation options, including polished metal parts and decals with graphics inspired by the United States military and British Air Force. The car comes in eight colours with shiny black edge detail. For the interior, there is a choice between black and brown leather. Morgan is serious about keeping with tradition and, even today, manual production is used to ensure outstanding quality and it stays true to the unique traditions of British craftsmanship. The focus here is on quality and not quantity. Morgan has said it will produce only 500 3 Wheelers per year – its first shipment has yet to leave the dock and all the cars have been snapped up. </p>";

Back in the days when the cruise liner was the most common mode of international transport, voyages could stretch 30 or 40 days, making the traveller’s luggage the vessel for all his everyday solutions, creature comforts and souvenirs. </p><p>From hat boxes to steamer trunks, each piece of vintage luggage embodies not just the highs and lows of travel, but is also a repository of memories from a different time in history. This is perhaps the reason why antique luggage cases appear to have a unique soul that veils interesting stories and intimate secrets, thus exciting the imagination and exerting a strangely moving force that lures all who stop to admire them. </p><p>As such, antique luggage pieces – real or revived – have become popular collectibles today. This is especially true for cases that are over a century old, that bear the stamps of a myriad journeys and, better yet, belonged to someone famous.</p><p>Louis Vuitton, Goyard and Hermès are all renowned luggage makers founded in the 19th century, whose fortunes were built on leather goods and cases. There remains a number of antique cases bearing their brands in circulation and several of these have found their way to auction houses and private collections.</p><p>At a Christie’s auction in London two years ago, 20 Louis Vuitton antique luggage cases dating back from the 19th century to the 1940s were presented in a segment the auction house called Style & Spirit. They included hand luggage, suitcases, hat boxes and other flat-top hard-edged trunks and cases used for travel. Reserve prices ranged from £400 to £4,000. </p><p>Several cases were monogrammed and bore the original tags from the voyages of yore and had accompanied their well-heeled owners on board luxury cruises and into plush hotels. </p><p>As a traveller and collector himself, Gaston-Louis Vuitton, the grandson of Louis Vuitton, was clear about his passion for antique luggage. He had written thus in the 1920s: \"What can be found on old luggage? There is the stamp of the means of transport employed, of the journeys made, of trips taken, all of which is marked on old papers and hotel labels. We will follow them and with them we will travel around the world.\" </p><p>Vintage luggage from Goyard is another favourite among collectors. Goyard’s early luggage items were made of canvas produced with linen, cotton and hemp, and treated with a natural coating before being covered with heavy leather. The results were traditionally good-looking and durable cases that have remained classics, passing through a century largely unchanged; small wonder that they remain in favour with the rich and famous.</p><p>Fans of Goyard luggage included the Russian Duke, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the Maharaja of Kapurthala, John Rockefeller and Arthur Conan Doyle.</p><p>A piece of antique Goyard luggage – depending on the model, condition, and historical value – can fetch between US$2,000 (S$2,590) and US$20,000 today. Last year, Mantiques Modern, an antique dealer based in New York, sold a custom Goyard Travel Drinking Set from the 1930s for US$2,800.</p><p>Jean-Michel Signoles, who currently heads up Goyard, is himself a fan of its luggage and has several antique luggage pieces in his collection. His acquisition of the brand in 1998 was in fact a fulfilment of a long-cherished dream.</p><p>Hermès luggage has always cost a pretty penny and draws all the attention and bids at antique bag auctions. Artcurial, the second largest auctioneer in France, has held two auctions dedicated to Hermès items each year for the past 13 years. Hermès bags also feature prominently in the dedicated annual fashion apparel auction at London’s Christie’s. </p><p>Antique apparel expert Abigail Rutherford, director of vintage couture and accessories at Leslie Hindman Auctioneers in Chicago, says: \"We found that the prices of Hermès and Chanel’s early collections were extremely high. Right now, you can probably get a new Hermès Kelly bag for US$6,000 to US$7,000, but in December 2009, we sold a 2002 Kelly bag at US$8,000 at an auction.\"</p><p>The iconic Birkin and Kelly in crocodile skin dominate auction sales of antique Hermès bags, fetching prices of up to tens of thousands of sterling pounds. In comparison, antique Hermès luggage is rarer. In 2009, Christie’s sold two beige Hermès hand luggage that were made in the mid-20th century for US$3,000 apiece. </p><p>As the retro trend catches on and antique luggage gets more hype than ever, Bottega Veneta launched a collection of luggage recently that recalls those hardy trunks, suitcases and beauty cases fabricated a century before. Complete with burnished metal hardware and reinforced corners, each piece is subtly, elegantly and undeniably vintage-inspired.</p>";

									var art_content = "<p><span><b>Snow White And The Batik Dwarves</b></span></p><p>\"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most cantik* of them all?\" </p><p>Not an impossible twist to the tale of Snow White if left to the devices of a stereotypical Nyonya matriarch as the Evil Queen. That the Peranakans of days past were indeed familiar with Grimm brothers’ fairy tales is evident in the existence of not one but two antique pieces of batik, dating back to the 1880s, that depict scenes from Snow White And The Seven Dwarves. </p><p>One hangs in the Peranakan Museum while another is part of a collection of nearly 800 antique batik pieces belonging to Lee Kip Lee and his wife, who are 90 and 77 years of age respectively. Their son Peter, 48, is a prominent independent curator and researcher of Peranakan heritage in Singapore. </p><p>The Lee family recently donated over 400 sarong kebaya (the traditional blouses worn by Nyonya women), some dating back to the 16th century, to the Peranakan Museum. Lee himself curated a headliner exhibition tracing the roots of the kebaya, that also featured batik sarongs (the wrapped skirts that accompany the kebaya) that they had loaned to the museum. </p><p>Batik depicting fairy tales are considered the holy grail for batik collectors because of their rarity, says Lee. They change hands for about $10,000 to $20,000 apiece and are usually sold via antique dealers to collectors and museums (one Canadian museum was said to have purchased a significant quantity recently). </p><p>Lee's Snow White piece, designed by Lien Metzelaar, a sought-after Eurasian batik designer of Dutch and Javanese origin, depicts the key scenes of the folktale: the Queen talking to the mirror and feeding Snow White the poison apple and the prince resurrecting Snow White from death. </p><p>The imagery, though still European, was all fascinatingly executed using the batik wax-resist technique, a dye method that is unmistakably Indonesian. One interesting liberty was taken during the adaption: For reasons unknown, the original seven dwarves were downsized to five. </p><p>The piece comes unstitched and measures about 215cm by 105cm, or the same size as a regular piece of batik. It was produced in Pekalongan, the Javanese centre of batik production in the 19th century. Lee believes it had been commissioned and sold to someone in the wealthy Eurasian, Chinese or Arab community. The complex and vivid illustrations were painstakingly hand-drawn by a team of artisans who each specialised in a different step required to produce a piece of batik. </p><p>On loan from the Lees to the Museum are two other \"fairy tale\" batik pieces featuring Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood. The latter was \"localised\" with a truly Asian motif: Instead of the Big Bad Wolf, the little girl is stalked by a half-Qilin, half-lion mythical creature.</p><p> These unusual works of art provide a refreshing departure from the cliched tropical floral motif on batik and strong evidence that the concept and excitement of fusion was already thriving here centuries ago. </p><p>In fact, sarong kebaya and Peranakan culture are in themselves products of fusion. The sarong kebaya is an intricate hybrid of sources hailing from India (dyed skirt cloths), the Islamic world (baju panjang, a long robe), China, South-east Asia and Europe (lace). </p><p>The sarong itself has its origin from the 14th century Gujarat and Coromandel dyed cloths, which the Indians had brought over to the Malay Archipelago and traded with the locals for spices. From Indian motifs to European fairy tales, the batik sarong has certainly come a long way − five centuries to be exact. </p><p>Lee’s scholarly unearthing of his Peranakan heritage stems from hybrid roots too. \"It all started with my mother. She is the collector and has an eye for things. From my father, I inherited the love for books.\" </p><p>Born into a family whose walls are replete with artefacts and collectibles, Lee married his parents’ strengths. He delved into books and records to make sense of the vast collections they had amassed that stretch back to the 16th century, some even older. Collecting then became another form of self-education. Whatever missing links he cannot resolve from what he reads, he learns through collecting. <br />\"I am strategic with my collecting. There is no point in collecting things that have been well-studied and well-known. I pick an area I can’t study,\" says Lee. </p><p>As a companion to the Sarong Kebaya exhibition he curated for the museum, Lee is currently working on a book tracing the origins and evolutions of the Peranakan costume, with cultural hybridity as its thrust. \"I want to get down to the roots of hybridity. You can see that hybridity in history was less calculated and more organic,\" he observes. In the heady days of vibrant international trade, the cross-pollination of Asian and European cultures were seen as the norm. </p><p>\"Traditional scholarly books tended to make sense of the world then by drawing clear boundaries based on regions of origin and races, etc. But the more you look back into history, the more you see that the making of culture and art is really an on-going hybrid process that taps into the spirit of the time.\" He concludes: \"This is not unique to the Peranakans.\"</p><p><span>*Beautiful in Malay</span></p><p><span>Snow White (belonging to the Peranakan Museum) and Red Riding Hood (on loan from the Lee family) in batik, along with hundreds of exquisite kebaya and some batik from Dutch museums, are on display at the Peranakan Museum till April 8. www.peranakanmuseum.sg.</span></p>";

Who would have thought they would emerge one day as red-hot collectibles and at capitalistically driven prices too?</p><p><b>Going Back In Time</b></p><p>Propaganda art arose after the founding of the People&apos;s Republic of China and peaked in popularity from 1966 to 1976, during the years of the Cultural Revolution, before sailing into the early 1980s on a high. </p><p>The posters were rendered in a style that is an artform in itself. To serve as inspiration and motivation for the various campaigns that were being launched in China at the time, they had shout out loud the incumbent messages of hope and optimism, through colour, typography and bold illustrations. </p><p>With a history spanning some 30 years, the genre saw thousands of posters and sculptures produced by organisations such as the Shanghai People’s Fine Arts Publishing House and other state-owned enterprises and government-backed artists. Each piece had a run ranging from a few thousand to tens of thousands.</p><p>The artistic style of the posters evolved with time. For example, images of cheery, lively and optimistic youths were all the rage in the early days of the establishment of New China; by the time the Cultural Revolution approached, the messages on the posters became more pointed. In the early 1980s, as many political campaigns came to a close, the slogans tended towards a call for harmony, unity and solidarity. \"The Flower of Friendship Blooms\" is one such example. </p><p>The artworks have a special place in society, for instantly tossing the viewer back to that certain time in history, evoking that revolutionary atmosphere when the \"sea of red\" prevailed. Propaganda art is gaining favour among collectors, especially if they came from that generation in China, with prices rising from the hundreds to thousands, mainly because of the strong doses of nostalgia that their distinctive style and bright colours evoke. </p><p>The most sought-after today are those depicting Mao Zedong. These usually bear realistic renditions of the man in bright colours and almost always feature eye-catching slogans that are memorable and hugely infectious.</p><p>Other images popular among collectors include those of the People’s Liberation Army with weapons in hand, anti-American imperialism proletariat and images relating to the Long March and the Great Leap Forward. Experts note that the posters are of a very high quality of print, show ample creativity, have a huge historical impact and are truly and unmistakably iconic products of their time. </p><p><b>Value Of Nostalgia</b></p><p>However, artists and illustrators paid little attention to the development and survival of propaganda posters back then, leading to the form’s gradual deviation from art and its descent to the realm of advertising, posters and brochures. </p><p>And while they were produced in great volume at one time, there is scant stock now, due to the fact that people of that era did not think of collecting them. Most posters were thrown out or destroyed after they were taken down. Only a fraction survived intact and those in mint condition are extremely rare.</p><p>By the end of the 1980s, propaganda art was largely ignored and collectors were able to procure the posters for mere cents at flea markets. Some were even spotted in trash compactors. </p><p>In the late 1990s, the tide turned when nostalgia grew rife in China and the posters started to grow in value. Soon, each piece could fetch up to US$5. These days, the posters cost around US$12 to 80, or up to 15 times more. On some American websites specialising in antiques, regular-sized propaganda posters (55x77cm) are priced between US$80 and US$500 each.</p><p>The auction house Sotheby’s once set up a dedicated arm to deal with propaganda art for a London auction in 2004. Eight posters were sold for a total of US$1,475 at the auction. </p><p>Another big-ticket item at the fair was a 61cm ceramic statue of Mao Zedong, which won a bid of US$2,430.</p><p>Currently, the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam has a collection of 1,400 Chinese propaganda art posters. They are accorded the same treatment as Chinese antiques and the institute has gone as far as to set up a dedicated museum to house its collection. </p><p>Back in 1979, the University of Westminster in London held an exhibition to showcase its collection of 1,500 propaganda posters. Well-preserved pieces are snapped up in the international market and can fetch a high price. There are a large number of collectors outside of China and some of the best known include Dutch scholar Stefan R. Landsberger and the writer John Gittings of the University of Westminster. Landsberger has a collection of 1,500 from different eras while Gittings has some 500 pieces. </p><p>As memories fade and history shows how far apart reality and ideals stand, period art not only stands the test of time but also gains in value for what it represents. China’s propaganda art reflect the important events in 30 years of Chinese history, offering an insight and snapshot of the times. Those days may be over, but when a cool eye is cast upon propaganda art, its historical significance and educational value remain. </p>";

Landsberger）和英国西威敏斯特大学的吉廷思（John Gittings），前者收藏1500多张不同时期的宣传画，后者则有500多张。 </p><p>时间消退了历史的记忆，现实远离了曾经的梦想，但时代的艺术却随着一个时代的逝去，反而变得更加珍贵。文革宣传画富有时代色彩，反映了中国建国30多年的所有重大事件，可说是一个特殊时代的缩影。虽然这段历史已经结束，但当人们用冷静的眼光重新欣赏研究中国宣传画历史时，仍会从中得到启迪和教益。</p>";

its position as one of the world's finest and most beloved watchmakers. </p><p>Giving voice to its horological achievements is Cartier Time Art, an exhibition that makes its Asian debut in Singapore at the Marina Bay Sands’ ArtScience Museum this month. </p><p>Designed by Japanese artist Tokujin Yoshioka, the show is a theatrical dreamscape that brings together the largest collection of

timepiece that miraculously works despite the obvious disconnect between the mechanism and the hands. </p><p>Another highlight is the 1916 Santos wristwatch, identical to the one made at the request of Alberto Santos-Dumont in 1904, to help the aviation pioneer navigate his aircraft without removing his hands from the navigation instruments to check the time. </p><p>In the Fine Watchmaking

the exhibition, visitors will also be able to see time-keeping treasures that are rarely available for viewing even in Cartier's boutiques. </p><p>The Crash watch is one such exhibit: produced in 1967, legend has that it was inspired by a damaged watch found at the scene of a car accident, although others say the design was borne of the surrealistic charms of Dali's paintings.</p><p>Other marvels on show that were created especially for Cartier's private clients include the 1928 Tank à guichets, which houses a jumping hour complication, purchased by the Maharaja of Patiala for whom Cartier also created a necklace and the largest ever piece of jewellery in the world. </p><p>The Tortue single push-piece chronograph wristwatch, a fine example of ingenious craftsmanship and innovation, that belonged to Edel Ford, son of Henry Ford and president of Ford Motor Company from 1919 to 1943, will also be on display. </p><p>These pieces will come alive in not a showroom but a show designed by visual maestro Yoshioka, 44, whose exhibition work are headline-grabbing spectacles that are exhibits in their own right. </p><p>A champion of wabi sabi, the Japanese language of aesthetic that celebrates the integrity of nature and its processes, he designs Issey Miyake stores and creates installations and exhibitions for such luxury marques as BMW and Hermes. </p><p>For Cartier Time Art, he opted for a primal and intimate theme. \"The moment the craftsman breathes life into the watch is the scenery, as if the heart of the watch starts beating and its life had begun,\" says the artist in an e-mail interview. </p><p>Last October, he visited Cartier Manufacture in La Chaux-de Fonds Valley in Switzerland for inspiration for this exhibition. </p><p>\"I witnessed that the essence of Cartier’s value lies not at the material level, but within the fact that its creation actually makes a culture of time itself,\" says Yoshioka on why he eschewed a message of opulence and luxury.</p><p> \"I have designed the exhibition in the hope that the visitors’ experience here will implant Cartier's new time beat in their hearts.\" </p><p>Yoshioka, whom Newsweek Japan once called one of the 100 most respected Japanese in the world, achieves this by treating the timepieces like beautiful bodies that house the spirit and soul of Father Time and strips them bare to reveal the essence of what makes a Cartier watch tick. </p><p>Little film vignettes which track various watch movements or recreate the processes of fine watchmaking are projected above the watches using 3-D movie technology so the images appear to dance on the glass cases in the darkness. </p><p>In so doing, he highlights both the \"finesse of the surface, but also the overwhelming sophistication and delicate beauty of the inner movements and workings of the watches, which not many people have a relationship with\", he explains. </p><p>The last exhibit in Cartier Time Art is meant to be an eye-opening gaze into Cartier's horological future as one of the world’s finest watchmakers. It showcases Cartier's revolutionary concept watch, the Cartier ID One, which does not require regulation or adjustment either during assembly or throughout its entire lifetime. </p><p>For this exhibit, Yoshioka employed optical art, where a large lens magnifies the comparatively small concept watch such that every one of its minute technical details can be seen as it ticks away, while hanging on a thread for the public's admiration. The result is an amazing funhouse effect, like the watch from the future is peering back at us even as we ogle at it. </p><p>\"The brightly lit white space represents Cartier's ever-lasting challenge, and the future. The sensitive movements of ID One, seen through the lens, reminds us of a sculptural piece, lasting its eternal life,\" Yoshioka elaborates. </p><p>Cartier Time Art is not the first collaboration between Yoshioka and Cartier. Two years ago, he used mirrors, projections and zoomed-in details to similar effect in Memories Of Cartier Creations at the Tokyo National Museum. </p><p>The artist has shown a preference for linking Cartier's heritage of watch craftsmanship to connotations of the past and future. His aim? \"To bring out and enhance Cartier’s unique beauty by merging the spirit of Cartier’s craftsmen, a long history and avant-garde ideas for the future.\" </p>";
